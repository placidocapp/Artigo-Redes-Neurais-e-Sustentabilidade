    abstract = { Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine the predictabilities of five intra-personal factors to predict pro-environmental consumer behavior (PECB) and the moderating role of religiosity in Oman. Design/methodology/approach The study uses neural network to analyze the antecedents/antecedents × religiosity → PECB relationships by using a sample of 306 consumers from Oman. Findings This study finds that the most important predictors of PECB, according to the order of importance, are attitude × religiosity, knowledge, concern × religiosity, knowledge × religiosity, value, religiosity, attitude, concern and value × religiosity. Research limitations/implications The convenience sample from a single Islamic country limits the generalizability of the findings. Future studies should use probabilistic sampling techniques and multiple Islamic countries located in different geographical regions. Practical implications To promote PECB, businesses and policymakers should provide environmental education to expand knowledge and value, leverage ecological religious values in integrated marketing communications, make positive inducements to change attitude and concern enhancing interventions. Social implications As religiosity enhances PECB by moderating the impacts of environmental intra-personal factors on PECB, businesses and policymakers should find ways to use faith-based ecological messages in Islamic countries. Originality/value Determining the predictabilities of psychological factors and their interactions with religiosity to predict PECB in Islamic countries is necessary for promoting environmentally friendly products in Islamic countries and for reducing the ecological damage to the environment. }

    abstract = { Purpose – The purpose of this study is to investigate forecast models using data provided by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) to monitor and develop forecast models for air quality management.Design/methodology/approach – The models used in this research are the LDF (Fisher Linear Discriminant Function), QDF (Quadratic Discriminant Function), REGF (Regression Function), BPNN (Backprop Neural Network), and the RBFN (Radial Basis Function Network). The data used for model evaluations span a 12‐year period from 1990 to 2002. A control chart of the data is also examined for possible shifts in the distribution of ozone present in the Houston atmosphere during this time period.Findings – Results of this research reveal variables that are significantly related to the ozone problem in the Houston area.Practical implications – Models developed in this paper may assist air quality managers in modeling and forecasting ozone formations using meteorological variables.Originality/value – This is the first study that has extensively compared the efficiency of LDF, QDF, REGF, BPNN and RBFN forecast models used for tracking air quality. Prior studies have evaluated Neural Networks, ARIMA and regression models. }

Then, the environmental impact factors analysis decision support system based on self‐organizing data mining model is designed.Design/methodology/approach – Applying data mining methods in the analysis and decision making of regional environmental impact factors will have broad perspective. Self‐organization data mining is a new modeling method of complex systems modeling with strong modeling capability. It was first presented by A.G. Ivakhnenko, based on the principle of self‐organization of biological cybernetics and Kolmogoorov‐Gabor polynomial function. In this paper, the impact factors of regional environment quality evolution based on self‐organization data mining method is studied, selecting the main impact factors of environment change automatically by computer simulation, analyzing the impact contribution rate of environmental impact factors.Findings – The environmental impact factors analysis decision support system based on self‐organizing data mining model is designed.Research limitations/implications – Accessibility and availability of data are the main limitations affecting which model will be applied.Practical implications – The paper has important theoretical and practical significance for the sustainable development of regional environment, resource, economy system and the constitution of environmental protection and management measures.Originality/value – This paper not only exploits new application domains of self‐organization data mining, but also explores new ways for regional environment impact factors analysis. }
