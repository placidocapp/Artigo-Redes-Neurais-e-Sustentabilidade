    abstract = { Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine the predictabilities of five intra-personal factors to predict pro-environmental consumer behavior (PECB) and the moderating role of religiosity in Oman. Design/methodology/approach The study uses neural network to analyze the antecedents/antecedents × religiosity → PECB relationships by using a sample of 306 consumers from Oman. Findings This study finds that the most important predictors of PECB, according to the order of importance, are attitude × religiosity, knowledge, concern × religiosity, knowledge × religiosity, value, religiosity, attitude, concern and value × religiosity. Research limitations/implications The convenience sample from a single Islamic country limits the generalizability of the findings. Future studies should use probabilistic sampling techniques and multiple Islamic countries located in different geographical regions. Practical implications To promote PECB, businesses and policymakers should provide environmental education to expand knowledge and value, leverage ecological religious values in integrated marketing communications, make positive inducements to change attitude and concern enhancing interventions. Social implications As religiosity enhances PECB by moderating the impacts of environmental intra-personal factors on PECB, businesses and policymakers should find ways to use faith-based ecological messages in Islamic countries. Originality/value Determining the predictabilities of psychological factors and their interactions with religiosity to predict PECB in Islamic countries is necessary for promoting environmentally friendly products in Islamic countries and for reducing the ecological damage to the environment. }

    abstract = { Purpose – The purpose of this study is to investigate forecast models using data provided by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) to monitor and develop forecast models for air quality management.Design/methodology/approach – The models used in this research are the LDF (Fisher Linear Discriminant Function), QDF (Quadratic Discriminant Function), REGF (Regression Function), BPNN (Backprop Neural Network), and the RBFN (Radial Basis Function Network). The data used for model evaluations span a 12‐year period from 1990 to 2002. A control chart of the data is also examined for possible shifts in the distribution of ozone present in the Houston atmosphere during this time period.Findings – Results of this research reveal variables that are significantly related to the ozone problem in the Houston area.Practical implications – Models developed in this paper may assist air quality managers in modeling and forecasting ozone formations using meteorological variables.Originality/value – This is the first study that has extensively compared the efficiency of LDF, QDF, REGF, BPNN and RBFN forecast models used for tracking air quality. Prior studies have evaluated Neural Networks, ARIMA and regression models. }

    abstract = { Purpose – This paper aims to outline a conceptual framework for the quality evaluation of web-based sustainability reports (SRs) aiding managers in determining and evaluating quality criteria for the sustainability report of their company. Design/methodology/approach – The paper reviews quality criteria in existing standards and guidelines on sustainability reporting and identifies research gaps. A conceptual framework including a multi-method approach for the quality evaluation of SRs is developed and evaluated. Findings – Existing standards and guidelines on sustainability reporting mainly focus on the content of the reports and neglect common information systems (IS) acceptance criteria such as ease of use and visual appeal. The proposed framework directly involves different stakeholder groups and research methodologies into the quality evaluation process. Research limitations/implications – The limitations of the research approach offer a number of starting points for future research. The proposed framework needs to be further evaluated by a larger number of test users in a more natural use setting. Practical implications – The application of a multi-method approach as well as the direct involvement of the stakeholders allows for an in-depth quality evaluation of SRs, enabling reporting companies to meet the readers' demand for information on economic, environmental and social activities of the reporting company. Common acceptance factors from the field of IS should be integrated into existing standards and guidelines on sustainability reporting. Coaching of the users through help functions, wizards, instructional videos or avatars is desirable. Originality/value – The proposed framework applies innovative technologies such as eye-tracking and software-supported attention analysis. By applying the framework to a set of sample reports, its usefulness and applicability are demonstrated. }

    abstract = { Purpose Integrating sustainability strategies with business processes is the most challenging task for industry professionals due to the lack of a proper understanding of sustainability concepts. At the same time, a lack of proper guidance restricts them from pursuing such activities. As far as the aspects of implementation are concerned, it is very tough to analyse and pick up key points to start with. The purpose of this paper is to utilize a text mining approach to analyse qualitative data and identify the critical issues for implementing sustainability in the manufacturing sector by focussing on turning processes based on the survey responses of researchers and industry professionals. Design/methodology/approach An integrated method employing principal component analysis (PCA) and the k-means clustering algorithm has been applied to extract useful information from a set of various suggestions provided by both the groups surveyed. The textual data has also been visualized using word clouds and, thus, it has been compared with the results of the text mining approach. Findings The results of the study indicate the importance of the role of government organizations and the need for a skilled workforce, which are crucial for enhancing aspects of sustainability in the manufacturing sector, as supported by both researchers and industry professionals. Besides this, researchers have highlighted the need to focus more on environmentally related issues, whereas industry professionals have raised performance-related issues. Practical implications The findings of the study present the important concerns of both the groups towards sustainability initiatives and, thus, will help to enhance the understanding of the underlying possibilities of negotiating jointly to enhance the performance of machining processes. Originality/value The novelty of this paper lies in its identification of important initiatives that are having a direct impact on the sustainable aspects of the machining process, based on the views of researchers and industry professionals. }
