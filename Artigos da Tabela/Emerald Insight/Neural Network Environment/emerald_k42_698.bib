    abstract = { Purpose – The purpose of this present study is to find a scientific method for the evaluation of environmental impacts according to the requirement 4.3.1.Design/methodology/approach – To realize the objectives, the authors worked with a representative sample from certified ISO 14001 organizations. The data aim to identify and evaluate (according to the organization's methodology) significant environmental impacts. In this study, the authors created two models for the evaluation of environmental impacts based on an artificial neural network applied in the pilot organization and compared the results obtained from these models with those obtained by applying an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method. AHP is part of an multi‐criteria decision making method and provides good multi‐criteria support for decision making for problems that can be structured hierarchically.Findings – This paper presents a new approach that uses a backpropagation neural network to evaluate environmental impacts regardless of the organization type.Originality/value – This paper presents a unique approach for the reliable and objective evaluation of environmental impacts. }

    abstract = { Understanding large amounts of information and efficiently using that information in improved decision making has become increasingly challenging as businesses collect terabytes of data. Businesses have turned to emerging technology including neural networks, symbolic learning, and genetic algorithms. In the current study, four classification methods were compared using results from an Indonesian contraceptive‐method preference survey. The four methods are linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, backpropagation neural networks, and modular neural networks. The modular neural network is a more complex and less frequently used neural network model. This comparative study gives insight into its performance on classifying observations from a challenging data set, the 1987 National Indonesia Contraceptive Prevalence Survey. }

    abstract = { Artificial neural networks (ANN) are appearing as alternatives to traditional statistical modeling techniques in many scientific disciplines. However, the inherent drawbacks of neural networks such as topology specification, undue training expense, local minima and training unpredictability will overlay their merits in engineering applications, especially. In this paper, adaptive radial basis function (ARBF) network and improved support vector machine (SVM) are presented in atmospheric sciences. The principle component analysis (PCA) technique is employed to the ARBF network as well, namely, ARBF/PCA network for the convenience of expression and comparison, so as to fasten the learning process. Comparing with traditional neural network models, the proposed models can automatically determine the size of network and parameters, fasten the learning process and achieve good generalization performances in prediction of pollutant level. The simulation results based on a real‐world data set demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed methods. }

    abstract = { Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to study the usefulness of neural network to explain the gap between behavior intention and actual behavior in the consumption of green products. The paper draws the base from theory of planned behavior (TPB) and social dilemma theory. Design/methodology/approach – Artificial neural networks were used to analyze the data. A survey instrument was developed to understand the behavior pattern of customers while purchasing energy-efficient products. The outputs and input variables were identified and the input variables were divided into binary and discreet inputs. Findings – The research attempts to identify the factors that drive as well as avoid green consumerism. It also details the measures that can be adapted to address the social dilemma of green consumerism. In general the paper identifies with the literature in eliciting that environmental consciousness does not drive green consumerism. Research limitations/implications – The results of the study have important implications for practitioners as well as researchers. It is observed that neural network also provides inconclusive evidence for the intention behavior gap. This can be further explored by identifying different elements of environment consciousness and further testing. Practical implications – Marketers need to have strategies interwoven with traditional influencers to promote their green offerings. The consumers expect a clear and measurable benefit to the green offerings that the marketers are marketing. Originality/value – The research has its conceptual base in the TPB and social dilemma theory to understand the drivers of purchase behavior while evaluating an electronic product available in both energy efficient non-energy efficient rating scenario. }
