abstract = "The paper analyses a model of the EU energy system by means of artificial neural networks. This model is based on the prediction of CO2 emissions until 2050 taking into account the current Energy Policy of the EU. The results show that artificial neural networks model this system very well and that this model has the ability to predict the behaviour of CO2 emissions. This will also enable timely response and correction of energy and economic strategy by changing the value of the relevant indicators in order to achieve the ambitious planned reductions of CO2 emissions by 2050. These plans are specified in the Energy Roadmap 2050 document of the European Commission from 2012 and promote economically cost-effective scenarios that will adapt the European Union's economy to the needs of environmental protection and the reduction of energy consumption. Several structures of Artificial Neural Networks were analysed in order to select the best one for modelling large energy systems. It was determined that the model with the Cascade Forward Back Propagation structure with numerous specific indicators can model such energy systems and predict of CO2 emissions with acceptable accuracy."

abstract = "This work addresses with sensitivity and uncertainty of the energy conversion of an oscillation-body wave energy converter with an artificial neural-network-based controller. The smart controller applies the model predictive control strategy to implement real-time latching control to the wave energy converter. Since the control inputs are future wave forces, an artificial neural network is developed and trained by the machine learning algorithm to predict the short-term wave forces based on the real-time measurement of wave elevation. The sensitivity of wave energy conversion with respect to wave frequency and receding horizon length are investigated. Uncertainties of the neural network that lead to the prediction deviation are identified and quantified, and their influences on the energy conversion are examined. The control command is derived inappropriately in the presence of prediction deviation leading to the reduction of energy absorption. Moreover, it is the phase deviation that reduces the energy absorption."

abstract = "The adoption of renewable energy technologies (RETs) as a sustainable practice in the residential construction sector depends on promotional efforts. With a modeling-based contribution, this research aims to analyze advertising effectiveness in the context of RETs adoption regarding solar water heaters. The study is based on a survey of 398 Iranian citizens. A neural network analysis was employed to identify advertising effectiveness in terms of the AIDA framework. The results indicated that the neural network is able to predict the relationships among advertising effectiveness indices; namely attention, interest, desire in the RETs setting, and action. According to the neural network analysis, attention was found to be the most significant predictor of action, followed by interest and desire."
