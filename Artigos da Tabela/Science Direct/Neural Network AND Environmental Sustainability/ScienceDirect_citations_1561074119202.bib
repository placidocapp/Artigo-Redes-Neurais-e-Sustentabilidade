abstract = "In recent years, with the raising of awareness in environmental protection and sustainable development in enterprises, the green issue has become more and more critical in supply chain management. This study intends to develop a green supplier selection model which integrates artificial neural network (ANN) and two multi-attribute decision analysis (MADA) methods: data envelopment analysis (DEA) and analytic network process (ANP). It is called ANN–MADA hybrid method. ANN–MADA hybrid method considers both practicality in traditional supplier selection criteria and environmental regulations. It also overcomes traditional DEA drawbacks, limitations of data accuracy and decision-making units (DMUs) amounts constraint. The model evaluation results of an international well-known camera manufacturer indicate that the ANN–MADA hybrid method outperforms two other hybrid methods, ANN–DEA and ANP–DEA. It was also discovered that ANN–MADA has better power of discrimination and noise-insensitivity in evaluating green suppliers’ performances."

abstract = "The Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the key components of the ICT infrastructure of smart sustainable cities as an emerging urban development approach due to its great potential to advance environmental sustainability. As one of the prevalent ICT visions or computing paradigms, the IoT is associated with big data analytics, which is clearly on a penetrative path across many urban domains for optimizing energy efficiency and mitigating environmental effects. This pertains mainly to the effective utilization of natural resources, the intelligent management of infrastructures and facilities, and the enhanced delivery of services in support of the environment. As such, the IoT and related big data applications can play a key role in catalyzing and improving the process of environmentally sustainable development. However, topical studies tend to deal largely with the IoT and related big data applications in connection with economic growth and the quality of life in the realm of smart cities, and largely ignore their role in improving environmental sustainability in the context of smart sustainable cities of the future. In addition, several advanced technologies are being used in smart cities without making any contribution to environmental sustainability, and the strategies through which sustainable cities can be achieved fall short in considering advanced technologies. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to review and synthesize the relevant literature with the objective of identifying and discussing the state-of-the-art sensor-based big data applications enabled by the IoT for environmental sustainability and related data processing platforms and computing models in the context of smart sustainable cities of the future. Also, this paper identifies the key challenges pertaining to the IoT and big data analytics, as well as discusses some of the associated open issues. Furthermore, it explores the opportunity of augmenting the informational landscape of smart sustainable cities with big data applications to achieve the required level of environmental sustainability. In doing so, it proposes a framework which brings together a large number of previous studies on smart cities and sustainable cities, including research directed at a more conceptual, analytical, and overarching level, as well as research on specific technologies and their novel applications. The goal of this study suits a mix of two research approaches: topical literature review and thematic analysis. In terms of originality, no study has been conducted on the IoT and related big data applications in the context of smart sustainable cities, and this paper provides a basis for urban researchers to draw on this analytical framework in future research. The proposed framework, which can be replicated, tested, and evaluated in empirical research, will add additional depth to studies in the field of smart sustainable cities. This paper serves to inform urban planners, scholars, ICT experts, and other city stakeholders about the environmental benefits that can be gained from implementing smart sustainable city initiatives and projects on the basis of the IoT and related big data applications."

After nearly 30 years’ development, a general cartography of existing research is now needed to reflect the major ideas and questions involved. This is carried out here by a bibliometric analysis. Following a basic review of the evolutionary progress of “green manufacturing” and similar concepts, we collect articles concerning green manufacturing, environmentally conscious/responsible manufacturing, benign manufacturing, and sustainable manufacturing. The data sources are limited to SCI and SSCI journals. Then we extract high frequency keywords from the articles and calculate their co-occurrence. A hierarchical clustering is conducted based on the co-word matrix, and six clusters are identified and visually presented by a strategic diagram and bi-dimensional multi-dimensional scaling diagrams. The six clusters cover the research subjects of green chemical materials, green manufacturing principles and approaches, common analytical tools, green manufacturing implementation of industrial firms, green supply chain, industrial ecology, GHG emissions, and green machining tools and processes. We build a framework to embed the green manufacturing system into the economic-social-eco system and divide green manufacturing research into three levels: application, organization, and system. Based on this framework, we combine the existing research architecture and research boundaries in the field and propose possible future research directions."

abstract = "The prognosis of forest structure along the cutting cycle, using models of individual trees, is one of the alternatives to manage tropical forests aiming at sustainability. Currently, in forest management practiced in the Amazon Region, growth and production models are not used to predict the future stock of the forest. Thus, the sustainable economic and environmental aspects of this activity remain uncertain. The aim of this present work was to model the growth of individual trees in a forest managed in the Amazon Region, by using artificial neural networks (ANN) to serve as subsidy to the wielder in obtaining future stock after logging, thus reducing uncertainty on forest management sustainability. Selective harvest was carried out in 1979 with an intensity of 72.5 m3ha−1 in a 64ha area in the Tapajós National Forest - PA. In 1981, 36 permanent plots (50m×50m) were installed at random and inventoried. There were nine successive measurements in 1982, 1983, 1985, 1987, 1992, 1997, 2007, 2010, and 2012. In the modeling of the future diameter, training and testing of ANN were carried out, including different semi-independent competition indexes (DSICI). All ANN, with and without DSICI, presented correlation above 99%, RMSE below 11%, and EF above 0.98. Based on the prognosis of tree growth, we were able to conclude that ANN can be effectively used to assist in the management of tropical forests and, thus, allow for the most suitable cutting intensity and cutting cycle per species, ensuring environmental and economic sustainability of forest management."

The paper shows that despite the increasing number of papers on the subject, several areas of research are still being neglected. In particular, the paper highlights six main literature gaps concerning the classification of green initiatives, the impact of green initiatives on LSP performance, the evaluation of sustainability performance, the factors influencing the adoption of environmental sustainability initiatives, the customer perspective in the sustainable supply chain, and the information and communication technologies supporting green initiatives. Starting from these six gaps, eight research questions have been identified. These research questions represent possible emerging areas of investigation on the topic."

The results of the study suggest that, using this procedure in advanced stages of product design process, designers can determine the set of product's physical attributes that best convey the idea of “environmentally sustainable” to the customer. The analysis of the obtained model allows establishing how different product's attributes influence users' perception.

abstract = "Smart growth, as a service to the economy, environment and society, has increasingly become the development pattern for cities of the world, but the degree of smart growth varies from city to city, and not all smart growth plans are suitable for current cities or countries. Therefore, it is of practical significance to measure the success degree of smart growth plan. The current model is accompanied by some problems such as subjectivity, unable to prioritize each plan, and so on. In this paper, an evaluating model was established to scientifically measure and adjust the smart growth plan based on BP neural network and set pair analysis. In this model, an evaluating metric(I) was defined, which was obtained by multiplying the ability score(A) and the coordinative development index(C). Applied to city's current plan, the model can tell us how successful the current plan is for this city, thus on the basis of evaluating result, better new plans for the city in the future can be developed. Finally, the effects of the new plans for population, economy-environment- society were discussed based on Lokta-Volterra equations and the environmental Kuznets curve. A case study was presented in two cities, Karamay and Atlanta. The result showed that the current plan in Atlanta is more successful than that in Karamay, but both the two plans are moderately successful. According to the results, a series of new plans were proposed and their priorities were ranked, the result showed that Atlanta should give priority to urban greening while Karamay give priority to economic development, and the effect of the scientific intelligence growth plan is to expand city's environmental capacity, promote the fair competition between the foreign population and the local population, and improve the balanced node, making the environment damage smaller, society and economic grow better. The model provides powerful reference for cities in developed and developing countries to formulate smart growth plans, especially for developing countries."

Effects from the removal of policy income support are also evaluated. For this purpose, a Multilayer Feedforward Neural Network is applied to model farmers’ behaviour over the period 2003–2007. Results indicate that the choice of decoupling direct payments from production, compared with the hypothesis of maintaining the previous policy regime, allowed a reduction in the use of chemicals in the regional case analysed. Positive environmental effects were relatively higher in farms that introduced crops only for obtaining short-term gains. Moreover, results show that the total removal of direct payments would have brought about stronger environmental benefits than decoupling, by pushing the most penalised farmers to reorient their production towards alternative activities."

In particular, we estimate the impact of these factors on Tobin's Q, which represents the overall technological and market strength of a firm as a forward-looking market performance reflecting stakeholders' expectations of the value of a firm. Using complementary regression and a neural network approach, we find that operational efficiency has the largest impact on Tobin's Q, followed by corporate reputation and environmental sustainability. In addition to its findings on the relative importance of these strategic factors, the paper's findings also suggest that operational efficiency, which reflects efficiency-driven best practice and managerial proficiency, is a crucial determinant of the market-facing measure of Tobin's Q in high-tech industries. Using models to estimate the interaction between these variables, we find that environmental sustainability and its interaction with reputation has the largest synergistic effect on Tobin's Q, followed by the interaction of reputation and operational efficiency. Our results show that the interaction of unique performance metrics can provide insights that differ from those derived from models for which the interaction is not included. Furthermore, the discovery of varying impact patterns under distinguishable capabilities is another significant finding of the paper."

The ANN model comprises one input layer, one hidden layer with seven neurons and one output layer. Ten variables affecting the amount of separately-collected packaging waste were identified and used in the ANN model. These variables are related to the level of education of the population, the size and level of urbanisation of the municipality, social aspects related to poverty and economic power and factors intrinsic to the waste collection service. A comparison between ANN and regression models for the estimation of packaging waste is also carried out. The performance of the proposed ANN model for a data set of 42 municipalities located in the centre of Portugal, measured by the R2, is 0.98. This value is 34% higher than the best regression model applied to the same data set (R2 = 0.73), indicating that ANN has a significantly higher explanatory power than traditional regression techniques. Another advantage is that ANN is not as sensitive to outliers as regression. However, ANN is more complex, has a higher number of variables, and the model development and interpretation of the results are more difficult. Nevertheless, the higher performance of ANN makes it a valuable tool in the definition of strategies to increase recycling and achieve circular economy goals."

The main motivation behind this research has been to examine the possibilities of improving slab design by including this methodology in future tools, which is capable of calculating thousands of solutions in real time based on the designer’s specifications. The process of creating these metamodels begins by developing a database of millions of combinations of slab designs. These combinations are calculated with a heuristic algorithm that provides the following results: rigidity, deflection, cost per square meter, CO2 emissions and embodied energy. Once a database including the entire universe of possible solutions has been created, a metamodel is developed that is capable of “condensing” the implicit knowledge contained in the database. This metamodel is included within a Decision Support System (DSS) that produces thousands of solutions for slabs that all comply with a range of specifications designated by the design plan. Furthermore, the methodology described herein proposes the use of Pareto-optimal solutions and graphic tools to help designers make multi-criteria decisions regarding the solutions that best fit their needs. A case study is presented to illustrate this proposal: optimizing slab design in two buildings according to technical, economic and sustainability criteria. The results indicate that the multi-criteria solutions obtained would entail a significant reduction in both emissions and embodied energy as compared to mono-criteria solutions, without significantly increasing costs."

We find that BDPA has significant impact on SP/EP. However, we did not find evidence for moderating role of flexible orientation and control orientation in the links between BDPA and SP/EP.

Then the linear autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and non-linear artificial neural network (ANN) models are applied to predict future ecological security. The results show that: (1) The per capita EF increased by three times from 1978 to 2013, whereas the per capita ecological carrying capacity experienced only a slight increase although the equivalence and yield factors were both enhanced. (2) The ‘degree of ecological security’ appeared to show a tendency to increase, indicating that China is in a ‘pretty unsafe’ ecological state. (3) EF intensity, which is used to represent the resource consumption level corresponding to unit economic output, indicated that the utilisation ratio of Chinese natural resources was greatly enhanced during the study period. (4) The ecological footprint diversity index, and ecological and economic coordination coefficient, peaked in the 1990s and then began to fall, indicating that China's ecological environment, as well as its coordination with the economy, was considered to be better in the 1990s but then gradually deteriorated. (5) The predictions of ARIMA–ANN model indicated that the degree of ecological security in China would reach an unsafe state in a few years if certain effective measures were not taken.

abstract = "Buildings are responsible for more than 30% of the total energy consumption and an equally large amount of related greenhouse gas emissions. Improving the energy performance of buildings is a critical element of building energy conservation. Furthermore, renovating existing buildings’ envelopes and systems offers significant opportunities for reducing Life Cycle Cost (LCC) and minimizing negative environmental impacts. This approach can be considered as one of the key strategies for achieving sustainable development goals at a relatively low cost, especially when compared with the demolition and reconstruction of new buildings. One of the main methodological and technical issues of this approach is selecting a desirable renovation strategy among a wide range of available options. The main idea and motivation behind this study relies on trying to bridge the gap between Simulation-Based Multi-Objective Optimization (SBMO) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). For a whole building simulation and optimization, current SBMOs often need thousands of simulation evaluations. Therefore, the optimization becomes unfeasible because of the computation time and complexity of the dependent parameters. To this end, one feasible technique to solve this problem is to implement surrogate models to computationally imitate expensive real building simulation models. The objective of the research focuses on developing a robust ANN to explore vast and complex data generated from the SBMO model. More specifically, this research aims to propose an accurate ANN to predict energy consumption using data from the SBMO model. The proposed model will potentially offer new venues to predict Total Energy Consumption (TEC), LCC, and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) for different renovation scenarios, and select the optimum scenario. To illustrate the applicability of the model, a case study was developed and the accuracy of the proposed model was evaluated. Results show that models constructed using ANNs are considerably less time-consuming than the conventional Building Energy Model (BEM) while achieving acceptable accuracy."
