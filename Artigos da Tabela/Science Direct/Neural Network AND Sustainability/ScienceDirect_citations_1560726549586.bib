abstract = "The need to promote a sustainable land management (SLM) approach for land degradation neutrality (LDN) is a global challenge, and we must rely on local assessments of how rural participants are conducting their work. Therefore, the objectives of the present research are as follows: 1) evaluate the fruit culture of the guava producers (Psidium guajava, L.) in Calvillo, Aguascalientes, Mexico; and 2) to show whether it is possible to detect key variables in SLM by using an artificial neural network to improve productivity. The study unit (SU) was located in the community of San Tadeo (21.917 °N and 102.701 °W) in the municipality of Calvillo, Aguascalientes. We considered a total of 430 ha established with this fruit and nine orchards that consisted of 9.05 ha, which is equivalent to 2.09% of the total area. Each hectare was randomly sampled, with a significance of 95% (α ≥ 0.05). The information was collected by using empirical field techniques and a questionnaire sent to the producers. The results revealed that the productive success of the SU is based on the knowledge and ability of the fruit farmers to take advantage of bioclimatic and biophysical conditions for guava cultivation. It was demonstrated in approximately 90% of the analyzed cases that the producer’s SLM was between regular and excellent. This result was confirmed by the index of edaphic adequacy (Iea), which was created by nine of thirteen variables measured in the field, that indicated in 47% of the orchards (OR), the edaphic condition is optimum (Iea = 0) or close to optimum (-0.2 ≥ Iea ≤ 0.2). In addition, by using a Multilayer Percetron (MLP), it was possible to detect two key aspects in the producers’ work: cava design (DC) and soil management (SM)."

abstract = "Sensitivity analysis establishes priorities for research and allows to identify and rank the most important factors which lead to great improvements in output factors. The aim of this study is to examine sensitivity analysis of inputs in grape production. We are proposing to perform sensitivity analysis using partial rank correlation coefficient (PRCC) which is the most reliable and efficient method, and we apply this for the first time in crop production. This research investigates the use of energy in the vineyard of a semi-arid zone of Iran. Energy use efficiency, energy productivity, specific energy and net energy were calculated. Various artificial neural network (ANN) models were developed to predict grape yield with respect to input energies. ANN models consist of a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with seven neurons in the input layer, one and two hidden layer(s) with different number of neurons, and an output layer with one neuron. Input energies were labor, machinery, chemicals, farmyard manure (FYM), diesel, electricity and water for irrigation. Sensitivity analysis was performed on over 100 samples of parameter space generated by Latin hypercube sampling method, which was then fed to the ANN model to predict the yield for each sample. The PRCC between the predicted yield and each parameter value (input) was used to calculate the sensitivity of the model to each input. Results of sensitivity analysis showed that machinery had the greatest impact on grape yield followed by diesel fuel and labor."

abstract = "Before a photovoltaic (PV) system is installed, a prerequisite modelling and performance analysis are carried out which estimates the performance parameters and reliability in operation of PV system. This paper proposes a neural network approach to performance prediction of PV Modules. Here the feed forward neural networks are used to predict I-V curve parameters as a function on input irradiance and temperature. K Fold cross-validation is used to validate model accuracy for determination of I-V curve parameters for five different technology modules, i.e., CdTe, CIGS, MICROMORPH, MUTICRYSTALLINE, MAXEON. A comparison is also drawn between the neural network predictor and the existing modeling procedures available. Model parameters have been determined following iterative, analytical and regression of known data points for seven and five parameter model of PV Modules. Among the electrical equivalent models, the seven parameter model is the most efficient model for performance prediction however commutation of model parameters in complex and tedious. Neural network model simplifies the computational process at the expense of higher error variance in comparison to electrical equivalent models. Further, a cascade implementation of the above two is designed and tested on Multicrystalline and Maxeon technology modules for higher model accuracy. The results obtained, verify the proposed cascaded model to be the most efficient model in comparison to independent models where mean bias error deviations are less than ±1% and error variance is reduced significantly. Also, a MATLAB based graphical user interface (GUI) is developed that can be used to predict the performance based on the analysis carried out. The proposed model is tested against a set of operating conditions and compared to the actual experimental values obtained using outdoor tests."

abstract = "Dramatically increased societal demands on the municipal services that contradict environmental protection and information processing capability oriented to resource utilization efficiency suffer from opposing simultaneous requirements. The smart city provides better solutions for urban areas which are increasing at an unprecedented speed. This paper presents an empirical study carried out to assess and analyze the development pattern of 35 smart cities in China using the principal component analysis (PCA) and back propagation (BP) neural network techniques. The proposed PCA-BP neural network assessment processing model is applied with six dimensional factors and twenty-two operating indices. With the feature extraction and performance score calculated via PCA, BP neural network is adopted for city classification to recognize the development differences in smart cities. The results indicate that the factor-driven impetus evolves into innovation-driven impetus, narrowing the gap from the holistic perspective between the first and middle-ranking groups, while two middle-ranking groups show a similar upward trend in terms of developing a smart economy through sustainable productivity in innovative enterprises and high-tech industry. To some extent, in response to a similar improving trend in the application of smart services, a distinct advantage of an individual index can be a complementary offset to unapparent holistic highlighting the reception of the lowest average points. Unbalanced development exists in two subaverage groups that are deficient in the initial inventory of smart infrastructure and demands. A relatively large difference exists in the smart mobility index among cities, whereas the opposite case is found concerning the smart environment index. Finally, corresponding optimized development pattern are recommended for building a sustainable smart city."

The simulated parameters (till an input heater temperature of about 250 °C) are compared with experimental results and the average error between the experimental approach and ANN based approach for all the parameter values is less than 3%. This low error value shows that the experiments need not be repeated for input temperatures above 250 °C which is quite complex. Hence, the effect of temperature gradient on the hybrid thermoelectric generator performance upto 350 °C of the hot side temperature with a single module and “N” no. of series connection have been estimated using ANN methodology. Experimental results suggest the necessity for ANN based approaches for hybrid TEG applications."

We construct a network of bike trips from the data, use a community detection method on the network, and find two communities with the most demand for shared bikes. We use data of stations in the two communities as our dataset, and train an deep LSTM model with two layers to predict bike renting and returning, making use of the gating mechanism of long short term memory and the ability to process sequence data of recurrent neural network. We evaluate the model with the Root Mean Squared Error of data and show that the prediction of proposed model outperforms that of other deep learning models by comparing their RMSEs."

The meaning of performance ratio is analyzed and the main affecting factors of the performance level for PV pumping system are also summarized. The second curvelet neural network is constructed combing the second curvelet transform and feed forward neural network, and the structure of second curvelet neural network is designed. The classification of training and testing samples are confirmed based on the improved grey clustering model, and the corresponding mathematical models are studied. The firefly algorithm is used to optimize the second curvelet neural network. The grey classifications of training samples are confirmed based on grey clustering, which are used to train the second curvelet neural network with different structure optimized by firefly with different parameters, and then the testing samples are used to carry out prediction analysis. Simulation results show that the second curvelet neural network has highest prediction precision and efficiency, which can correctly and efficiently predict the performance ratio of PV pumping system."

An artificial neural network was employed to create a surrogate of the DayCent biogeochemical simulation model. Our optimization considered trade-offs among seven different objectives at different scales, including farm profits, irrigation water use, corn grain, corn stover, soil organic carbon (SOC), greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and nitrogen leaching. The results show that the surrogate captured greater than 99% of the variations in the DayCent’s simulated outputs and was 6.2 million times faster than the DayCent model for our analysis. Farm-level optimization increased farm profits by 83%–150%, SOC by 16%–53%, grain yield by 10.1–11.3%, and reduced GHG emissions by 19%–55% compared to the ‘business-as-usual’ scenario."
