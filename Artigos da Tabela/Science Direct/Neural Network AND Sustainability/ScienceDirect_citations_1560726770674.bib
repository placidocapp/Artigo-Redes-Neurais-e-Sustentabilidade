abstract = "Predicting solar irradiance has been an important topic in renewable energy generation. Prediction improves the planning and operation of photovoltaic systems and yields many economic advantages for electric utilities. The irradiance can be predicted using statistical methods such as artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), or autoregressive moving average (ARMA). However, they either lack accuracy because they cannot capture long-term dependency or cannot be used with big data because of the scalability. This paper presents a method to predict the solar irradiance using deep neural networks. Deep recurrent neural networks (DRNNs) add complexity to the model without specifying what form the variation should take and allow the extraction of high-level features. The DRNN is used to predict the irradiance. The data utilized in this study is real data obtained from natural resources in Canada. The simulation of this method will be compared to several common methods such as support vector regression and feedforward neural networks (FNN). The results show that deep learning neural networks can outperform all other methods, as the performance tests indicate."

An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) has been used to develop a thermodynamic model to be used for the maximization of the production of power while keeping the size of the heat exchangers and hence the cost of the plant at its minimum. R1234yf has been selected as the working fluid. The results show that the use of ANN is promising in solving complex nonlinear optimization problems that arise in the field of thermodynamics."

abstract = "Energy consumption forecast is essential for strategic planning in achieving a sustainable energy system. The hemispherical seasonal dependency of energy consumption requires intelligent forecast. This paper uses a non-linear autoregressive neural network (NARNET) for energy consumption forecast in a South African University with four campuses, using three-year daily energy consumption data. Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) technique was used for the data filtering. Three window lengths (L=54, 103 and 155) were obtained using periodogram analysis and R-values of network training at these window lengths were compared. Filtered data at L=103 gave the best R-values of 0.951, 0.983, 0.945 and 0.940 for campus A, B, C, and D respectively. The network validation and a short-term forecast were performed. Forecast accuracies of 85.87%, 75.62%, 85.02% and 76.83% were obtained for campus A, B, C and D respectively. The study demonstrates the significance of data filtering in forecasting univariate autoregressive series."

abstract = "In order to achieve near-optimal fuel economy for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) using the equivalent consumption minimum strategy (ECMS), it is necessary to dynamically tune the equivalent factor (EF). Unlike widely used model-based approaches, this paper proposes a data-driven ECMS that determines the EF using an artificial neural network (ANN). First, by comparing Pontryagin's Minimum Principle (PMP) with the ECMS, one can find that the EF is related to the co-state value of the PMP method. Then, an ANN is constructed with three accessible input variables, including the current demanded power, the ratio of the distance travelled to the total distance, and the battery State of Charge (SOC). The neural network is subsequently trained using real-world speed profiles. Simulations are performed considering different initial SOC values. The results reveal that the proposed data-driven ECMS demonstrates satisfactory fuel economy compared to global optimization methods like dynamic programming and PMP methods. The computational time of the proposed method relative to the duration of the entire trip indicates a great potential for the development of a time-conscious energy management strategy. Moreover, the impact of training sample size on the ANN performance is discussed."

There is a grand variety of systems and services related to buildings, in order to better control and monitoring. The prompt taking of decisions may prevent costs and contamination. This paper proposes a method for energy consumption forecasting in public buildings, and thus, achieve energy savings, in order to improve the energy efficiency, without affecting the comfort and wellness. The prediction of the energy consumption is indispensable for the intelligent systems operations and planning. We propose an Elman neural network for forecasting such consumption and we use a genetic algorithm to optimize the weight of the models. This paper concludes that the proposed method optimizes the energy consumption forecasting and improves results attained in previous studies."

abstract = "This paper presents the potential energy savings and how to achieve sustainability by predicting the temperature of aggregate stockpiles in the production process of asphalt mixtures. A possible way to achieve energy efficiency and therefore sustainability is to preheat the mineral mixture, i.e. the aggregate, before it enters the production process in the asphalt mixing plant, thus resulting in lower energy consumption per ton of asphalt. The main objective of the conducted research was to develop and test an artificial neural network (ANN) model and analyse the influence of three independent variables (hour in the day, season, air temperature) on the one dependent variable (temperature of the mineral mixture). The impact of the observed independent variables on the temperature of the mineral mixture is analysed in a standard uncovered aggregate stockpile and in a solar aggregate stockpile. From the obtained modelling results, it can be concluded that it is possible to successfully use ANN in the process of predicting the temperature of aggregate stockpiles in the processes of aggregate production and storage as part of the whole production process of asphalt mixtures."
