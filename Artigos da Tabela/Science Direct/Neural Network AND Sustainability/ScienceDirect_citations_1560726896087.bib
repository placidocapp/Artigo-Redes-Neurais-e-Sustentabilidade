abstract = "Renewable energy from wind and solar resources can contribute significantly to the decarbonisation of the conventionally fossil-driven electricity grid. However, their seamless integration with the grid poses significant challenges due to their intermittent generation patterns, which is intensified by the existing uncertainties and fluctuations from the demand side. A resolution is increasing energy storage and standby power generation which results in economic losses. Alternatively, enhancing the predictability of wind and solar energy as well as demand enables replacing such expensive hardware with advanced control and optimization systems. The present research contribution establishes consistent sets of data and develops data-driven models through machine-learning techniques. The aim is to quantify the uncertainties in the electricity grid and examine the predictability of their behaviour. The predictive methods that were selected included conventional artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector regression (SVR) and Gaussian process regression (GPR). For each method, a sensitivity analysis was conducted with the aim of tuning its parameters as optimally as possible. The next step was to train and validate each method with various datasets (wind, solar, demand). Finally, a predictability analysis was performed in order to ascertain how the models would respond when the prediction time horizon increases. All models were found capable of predicting wind and solar power, but only the neural networks were successful for the electricity demand. Considering the dynamics of the electricity grid, it was observed that the prediction process for renewable wind and solar power generation, and electricity demand was fast and accurate enough to effectively replace the alternative electricity storage and standby capacity."

abstract = "Valid and dependable water demand prediction is a major element of the effective and sustainable expansion of municipal water infrastructures. This study provides a novel approach to quantifying water demand through the assessment of climatic factors, using a combination of a pretreatment signal technique, a hybrid particle swarm optimisation algorithm and an artificial neural network (PSO-ANN). The Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) technique was adopted to decompose and reconstruct water consumption in relation to six weather variables, to create a seasonal and stochastic time series. The results revealed that SSA is a powerful technique, capable of decomposing the original time series into many independent components including trend, oscillatory behaviours and noise. In addition, the PSO-ANN algorithm was shown to be a reliable prediction model, outperforming the hybrid Backtracking Search Algorithm BSA-ANN in terms of fitness function (RMSE). The findings of this study also support the view that water demand is driven by climatological variables."

Street lighting system is one of the part of the facility provided in smart cities. The unwanted utilisation of the street lighting affects the economic status of the country indirectly. Power consumption through street lighting is major problem, hence action plan is taken to promote the reduction policies of the power consumption. Reducing the unnecessary power consumption is not a simple task, but with soft computing approaches power consumption can be reduced. The objective of this article is to present an ANN based energy efficient smart street lighting systems. The proposed design were implemented and executed in a residential area, Hosur and the results are carried out at different scenarios and various seasons.

abstract = "In this paper, we explore the strategic significance of three factors – operational efficiency, measured by data envelope analysis; environmental sustainability, represented by Newsweek's Green Rankings; and corporate reputation, based on Fortune's list of most admired companies in the world –and their relationship to the market valuation of high-tech-oriented companies. In particular, we estimate the impact of these factors on Tobin's Q, which represents the overall technological and market strength of a firm as a forward-looking market performance reflecting stakeholders' expectations of the value of a firm. Using complementary regression and a neural network approach, we find that operational efficiency has the largest impact on Tobin's Q, followed by corporate reputation and environmental sustainability. In addition to its findings on the relative importance of these strategic factors, the paper's findings also suggest that operational efficiency, which reflects efficiency-driven best practice and managerial proficiency, is a crucial determinant of the market-facing measure of Tobin's Q in high-tech industries. Using models to estimate the interaction between these variables, we find that environmental sustainability and its interaction with reputation has the largest synergistic effect on Tobin's Q, followed by the interaction of reputation and operational efficiency. Our results show that the interaction of unique performance metrics can provide insights that differ from those derived from models for which the interaction is not included. Furthermore, the discovery of varying impact patterns under distinguishable capabilities is another significant finding of the paper."

abstract = "This study considered combinational control approaches for predicting electricity consumption in a building based on an optimized back-propagation (BP) neural network. Forecasting the electricity consumption of buildings is an important part of power management systems because it directly affects power dispatching and safe production. The BP neural network prediction method is used widely for this purpose because of its high plasticity and simple structure, but it has disadvantages such as slow convergence, fluctuations, and oscillation during training. We propose the use of the Levenberg–Marquardt back-propagation (LM-BP) neural network to enhance the accuracy of predictions by combining the gradient descent and Quasi-Newton method, thereby ensuring the fast convergence speed and maintaining better overall performance. Additionally, the network weights can be optimized by adaptive adjustment between the steepest gradient descent method and the Gauss–Newton method so the network can converge effectively. Hence, the accuracy and stability of the LM algorithm are improved, and a building electricity consumption prediction model can be established based on the improved BP neural network. Our results demonstrate that the forecasting model based on LM-BP neural network improves the accuracy and stability of predictions, and it is suitable for the short-term prediction of building electricity consumption."

abstract = "An accurate and effective air quality index (AQI) forecasting is one of the necessary conditions for the promotion of urban public health, and to help society to be sustainable notwithstanding the effects of air pollution. This study proposes a hybrid AQI forecasting model to enhance forecasting accuracy. Variational mode decomposition (VMD) was applied to decompose the original AQI series into different sub-series with various frequencies. Then, sample entropy (SE) was applied to recombine the sub-series to solve the issues of over-decomposition and computational burden. Next, a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network was established, to forecast those new sub-series, following which the ultimate AQI forecast could be obtained, by accumulating prediction values from each sub-series. The results illustrated that: (1) the proposed VMD-SE-LSTM model displayed superior capacity for daily urban AQI forecasting, as shown using test case data from Beijing and Baoding; (2) when the proposed model was compared with other models, the results indicated that VMD-SE-LSTM model comprehensively captured the characteristics of the original AQI series. Besides, the proposed model had a high rate of correct AQI class forecasting, which existing single models cannot achieve, while other hybrid models can only reflect AQI series trends with limited prediction accuracy."
