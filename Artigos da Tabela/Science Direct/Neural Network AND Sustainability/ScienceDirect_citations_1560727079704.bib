abstract = "Nowadays there is an evident concern regarding the efficiency and sustainability of the transport sector due to both the threat of climate change and the current financial crisis. This concern explains the growth of railways over the last years as they present an inherent efficiency compared to other transport means. However, in order to further expand their role, it is necessary to optimise their energy consumption so as to increase their competitiveness. Improving railways energy efficiency requires both reliable data and modelling tools that will allow the study of different variables and alternatives. With this need in mind, this paper presents the development of consumption models based on neural networks that calculate the energy consumption of electric trains. These networks have been trained based on an extensive set of consumption data measured in line 1 of the Valencia Metro Network. Once trained, the neural networks provide a reliable estimation of the vehicles consumption along a specific route when fed with input data such as train speed, acceleration or track longitudinal slope. These networks represent a useful modelling tool that may allow a deeper study of railway lines in terms of energy expenditure with the objective of reducing the costs and environmental impact associated to railways."

abstract = "This paper proposes an integrated (hybrid) Artificial Neural Network-Bayesian (ANN-B) modelling approach to improve the accuracy of predicting seasonal water allocation prices in Australia’s Murry Irrigation Area, which is part of one of the world’s largest interconnected water markets. Three models (basic, intermediate and full), accommodating different levels of data availability, were considered. Data were analyzed using both ANN and hybrid ANN-B approaches. Using the ANN-B modelling approach, which can simulate complex and non-linear processes, water allocation prices were predicted with a high degree of accuracy (RBASIC = 0.93, RINTER. = 0.96 and RFULL = 0.99); this was a higher level of accuracy than realized using ANN. This approach can potentially be integrated with online data systems to predict water allocation prices, enable better water allocation trade decisions, and improve the productivity and profitability of irrigated agriculture."

abstract = "Drought is one of the most significant natural phenomena affecting different aspects of human life and the environment. Due to water scarcity, prediction of water quality reduction is very crucial for urban and rural communities. This study contributes by applying artificial neural network and modified fuzzy clustering techniques to estimate the drops in potential drinking water quality in the GIS environment. In this research, the probability of occurrence of adverse annual changes in the water quality of drinking water is estimated. The model was tested using real instances of the southeast aquifers, the regions of the central parts of the IRAN and especially the significant portions of the aquifers of the east area. To validate the model, the data adequacy test and the standardization of the drought index are used. The results of the lowest available water quality and the highest drought using ANNs show that the qualitative stress conditions in large part of the country's aquifers are in unfavorable conditions. Evidence from this research shows that the aquifers in these areas are expected to have severe drought stress and poor quality class status. Also, the computational results indicate that the modified clustering method increases the efficiency of the prediction model as against the previous research. The outcomes do not show a relatively favorable state of drinking water quality for some aquifers in the country. However, the conditions for quantitative changes in the depth of water, based on the predicted results of ANN, are considered critical. The generated maps demonstrate that about 64% of the study area is subjected to a severe deterioration in the quality of drinking water if the current trend continues in the exploitation of aquifers. As a result, the main finding the present study is that the probability of groundwater quality decline is significant in many aquifers in the country."

abstract = "Engineered cementitious composite (ECC) is a type of cement-based material fabricated with a variety of add-in functional fillers, featuring superior properties of strain-hardening, ductility and energy absorption. Proper composition is essential for designing ECC material, which may lead to different mechanical and electrical properties. However the design for ECC is still a complex process on the basis of micro-mechanism followed by numerical and experimental analyses, and there is no simple model yet for practical engineering application. This study presents the prediction of mechanical and electrical properties of ECC based on the artificial neural network (ANN) technique with the aim of providing a gateway for a more efficient and effective approach in ECC design. Specifically, neural network models were developed for ECCs reinforced with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fibre or steel fibre (SF) with experimental data collected from other researchers for training. The development, training and validation of the proposed models were discussed. To assess the capability of well-trained ANN models for property prediction, experimental studies were conducted, including compression test, four-point bending test, tensile test and electrical resistance measurement for ECCs of various composition. Excellent consistency between the predicted and tested results is obtained, demonstrating the feasibility of ANN models for property prediction of ECCs."

abstract = "Wind power generation highly depends on the atmospheric variables which itself depend on the time of the day, months and seasons. The intermittency of wind hinders the accuracy of wind forecasting, which is important for safe operation and reliability of future power grid. One way to address this problem is to consider all these atmospheric variables which can be obtained from Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models. However, using NWP parameters increases the complexity of the forecast model and it requires a large amount of historic data. Additionally, different models are required for different seasons or months. This paper presents a wavelet-based neural network (WNN) forecast model which is robust enough to predict the wind power generation in short-term with significant accuracy, and this model is applicable to all seasons of the year. With reduced complexity, the model requires less historic data as compared to that in available literatures."

Seven parameters including month of the year, sunshine duration, mean temperature, rainfall, wind speed, relative humidity, and daily global solar radiation are selected as the evaluating indices. The predictions from the BPNN optimized by PSO model were compared with those from two models: BPNN and BPNN optimized by GA. The results show that the proposed BPNN optimized by PSO model has potential in accurately predicting the daily diffuse solar radiation."

abstract = "This paper proposes an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict the solar energy generation produced by photovoltaic generators. The intermittent nature of solar power creates two main issues. Firstly, power production and demand have to be balanced to ensure the control of the whole system, and the inherent variability of clean energies makes this difficult. Secondly, energy generation companies need a highly accurate day-ahead or intra-day estimation of the energy to be sold in the electricity pool. For the tool developed in this paper, we address the issue of the complexity of control in systems that are based on solar energies. The tool's ability to predict the parameters that are involved in solar energy production will allow us to estimate the future power production in order to optimise grid control. Our tool uses an ANN which we developed using MATLAB® software. The results were validated by analysing the root mean square error of the prediction for days outside the database used for training the ANN. The difference between the actually produced and predicted energy is about 0.5–9%, meaning that the accuracy of our tool is sufficient enough to be installed in systems which have integrated solar generators."

abstract = "The stochastic character of wind power generation suggests limitations on the increased shares of wind energy in electricity systems and challenges market integration of wind power, mainly due to the fact that nowadays, new wind parks are set to cope with more dynamic pricing mechanisms. In this new environment, where advanced bidding strategies need to be adopted from wind power actors, the introduction of novel elements to support wind power generation and address the inherent impact of variability is thought to be a prerequisite. To this end, the current study expands the work of previous studies by examining different methods of prediction with regards to wind power forecasting. More specifically, both Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) models are trained and tested on the basis of different prediction horizons, using as case study real wind speed and wind power generation measurements from a wind park operating in the Greek territory. Models are trained using an in-house forecasting tool, with results obtained reflecting the better fit of the SVR method overall, especially for time horizons longer than 6 hours ahead. At the same time, an effort is made in order to optimize prediction of wind power generation through the combination of both prediction approaches via clustering of prediction areas. This novel approach results in an improvement of the predictions obtained, despite the fact that the SVR method already performs sufficiently even for 24 hours ahead."
