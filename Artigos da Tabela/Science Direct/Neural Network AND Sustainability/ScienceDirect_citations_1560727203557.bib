abstract = "Neural networks with a good modeling capability have been used increasingly to predict and forecast solar radiation. Even diverse application of neural network has been reported in literatures such as robotics, pattern recognition, forecasting, power systems, optimization and social/psychological sciences etc. The models have categorized the review under three major performance schemes such as delay, number of neurons and activation function for establishment of neural network architecture. In each of these categories, we summarize the major applications of eight well recognized and often used neural network models of which the last two are custom based. The anticipated model are initiated and validated with 10 metrological parameters further in sub-categories. Evaluation of its accuracy associated with special flexibility of the model is demonstrated through the results based on parameter range. In summary, we conclude the best result showing that the delays, neuron, transfer function, model, parameters and RMSE errors are in range of 15 or 30, 10 or 20, tansig, Elman Back Propagation network, bulb point temperature or direct normal radiation, 9–10 and 25–35% training to the test cases. The review discloses the incredible view of using the neural networks in solar forecast. The work of other researchers in the ﬁeld of renewable energy and other energy systems is also reported which can be used in the future in the works of this field."

abstract = "This paper presents a review on the application of neural networks for the estimation, forecasting, monitoring, and classification of exogenous environmental variables that affect the performance, salubrity, and security of cities, buildings, and infrastructures. The forecast of these variables allows to explore renewable energy and water resources, to prevent potentially hazardous construction locations, and to find the healthiest places, thus promoting a more sustainable future. Five research themes are covered—solar, atmospheric, hydrologic, geologic, and climate change. The solar section comprises solar radiation, direct and diffuse radiation, infrared and ultraviolet radiation, clearness index, and sky luminance and luminous efficacy. The atmospheric section reviews wind, temperature, humidity, cloud classification, and storm prediction. The hydrologic section focuses on precipitation, rainfall-runoff, hail, snow, drought, flood, tides, water levels, and other variables. The geologic section covers works on landslides, earthquakes, liquefaction, erosion, soil classification, soil mechanics, and other properties. Finally, climate change forecasting and downscaling of climate models are reviewed. This work demonstrates the wide range of applications of these methods in different research fields. Some research gaps and interdisciplinary research opportunities are identified for future development of comprehensive forecast and evaluation approaches regarding the estimation of renewable energy and built environment-related variables."

abstract = "Predicting soil moisture quantity could directly help the people engaged in sustainable agriculture and associated socio-economic structures. Recently researchers have engaged traditional and machine learning based models to predict soil moisture quantity. In the current study a modified Flower Pollination Algorithm (MFPA) has been employed to train Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict soil moisture quantity. The proposed method is compared with well known PSO (Particle Swarm optimization) supported ANN and Cuckoo Search (CS) supported ANN along with MLP-FFN classifier. The stability of the proposed model in presence of varying weather conditions has been established by performing a stability analysis using data level perturbation. Experimental results have indicated that NN-MFPA achieved an average RMSE of 0.0019 and outperformed other models. The ingenuity of the proposed model is further established by performing Wilcoxon rank test with 5% level of significance."

abstract = "Wind power is one of the most attractive forms of electricity from the viewpoints of cost efficiency and environmental protection. However, the instability of wind power has a serious impact on a grid system. Reliable wind power forecasting will help to utilize storage systems and backup generators effectively for mitigating the instability. This paper proposes a feature extraction procedure for numerical weather prediction (NWP) data based on the three-dimensional convolutional neural networks (3D-CNNs). An advantage of 3D-CNNs is to automatically extract the spatio-temporal features from NWP data focusing on the targeted wind farm. Feature extraction based on 3D-CNNs was applied to real-world datasets; the results show significant performance in comparison to several benchmark approaches, and also show that the proposed extraction scheme based on 3D-CNNs achieves to derive intrinsic features for prediction of wind power generation from NWP data."

abstract = "Through a modelling-based contribution, this paper critically reviews and explores the impact of low carbon heat policies to induce technological policy development. The paper interrogates an Irish government funded sustainable energy financed scheme (the ‘Greener Homes Scheme’), launched in 2006 and aimed at the deployment of low carbon technology in the residential sector. This paper analyses 31,560 technology installations supported under this scheme and it utilises artificial neural network modelling as a method of better analysing and understanding the effects, relationships and dependencies that influence consumer decision making and responses to new technological policies. It is responding to a perceived limited understanding of the variables that influence a wider adoption of low carbon technologies and the opportunities and potential that could result in a wider appreciation of the broader impact of market barriers. It builds up on the artificial neural networks modelling work, explores its application in pattern recognition and interprets its influence in predicting customer behaviour. The paper provides an enhanced understanding of the various factors that influence consumer selection of one low carbon technology over another. Evaluation of the results revealed that the developed artificial neural network model (generic 7-6-4 neurons layered architecture) is the most appropriate tool and suitable network in predicting indices, based on certain social conditions, on the choice of certain low carbon technologies."
