abstract = "This study estimated energy use flow of buffalo farms, energy use indices, production efficiency, energy use targets, impact of energy inputs on energy output, and sensitivity analysis of energy inputs. A well-structured questionnaire was used to collect data of 360 domestic buffalo farms from Punjab Pakistan during May-July, 2017. Results revealed that milk production was mainly dependent on renewable energy inputs, particularly millet, minerals, concentrates, and sorghum. Energy use efficiency (0.08) and production efficiency (0.24) indicate that energy inputs were overused. An artificial neural network (ANN) method suggested that 30.5% of total energy input could be saved if farmers followed the targeted inputs recommended by ANN. The Cobb-Douglas production function found a negative significant impact of sorghum, millet, and wheat straw; and positive significant impact of labour, concentrates, and electricity on energy output. Among the non-renewable energy sources, electricity was found to be the most wasteful use of energy input, mainly due to the mismanagement of farmers. Sensitivity analysis estimated that a unit increase in renewable energy significantly decreased milk yield by 0.02 unit. While a unit increase in non-renewable energy significantly increased milk yield by 0.01 unit. This study stresses the importance of using energy inputs at the target quantities prognosticated by ANN method, and recommends the use of energy-efficient equipment."

abstract = "The paper analyses a model of the EU energy system by means of artificial neural networks. This model is based on the prediction of CO2 emissions until 2050 taking into account the current Energy Policy of the EU. The results show that artificial neural networks model this system very well and that this model has the ability to predict the behaviour of CO2 emissions. This will also enable timely response and correction of energy and economic strategy by changing the value of the relevant indicators in order to achieve the ambitious planned reductions of CO2 emissions by 2050. These plans are specified in the Energy Roadmap 2050 document of the European Commission from 2012 and promote economically cost-effective scenarios that will adapt the European Union's economy to the needs of environmental protection and the reduction of energy consumption. Several structures of Artificial Neural Networks were analysed in order to select the best one for modelling large energy systems. It was determined that the model with the Cascade Forward Back Propagation structure with numerous specific indicators can model such energy systems and predict of CO2 emissions with acceptable accuracy."

abstract = "Smart growth, as a service to the economy, environment and society, has increasingly become the development pattern for cities of the world, but the degree of smart growth varies from city to city, and not all smart growth plans are suitable for current cities or countries. Therefore, it is of practical significance to measure the success degree of smart growth plan. The current model is accompanied by some problems such as subjectivity, unable to prioritize each plan, and so on. In this paper, an evaluating model was established to scientifically measure and adjust the smart growth plan based on BP neural network and set pair analysis. In this model, an evaluating metric(I) was defined, which was obtained by multiplying the ability score(A) and the coordinative development index(C). Applied to city's current plan, the model can tell us how successful the current plan is for this city, thus on the basis of evaluating result, better new plans for the city in the future can be developed. Finally, the effects of the new plans for population, economy-environment- society were discussed based on Lokta-Volterra equations and the environmental Kuznets curve. A case study was presented in two cities, Karamay and Atlanta. The result showed that the current plan in Atlanta is more successful than that in Karamay, but both the two plans are moderately successful. According to the results, a series of new plans were proposed and their priorities were ranked, the result showed that Atlanta should give priority to urban greening while Karamay give priority to economic development, and the effect of the scientific intelligence growth plan is to expand city's environmental capacity, promote the fair competition between the foreign population and the local population, and improve the balanced node, making the environment damage smaller, society and economic grow better. The model provides powerful reference for cities in developed and developing countries to formulate smart growth plans, especially for developing countries."

abstract = "The purpose of this paper is to model electricity consumption using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Total electricity consumption and consumption generated by households (HH) were modeled. The input variables of the ANN were based on nighttime light images from VIIRS DNB. Studies conducted thus far have covered mainly linear models. Most of case studies focused on single countries or groups of countries with only few focusing on the sub-national scale. This paper is pioneering in covering an area of Poland (Central Europe) at NUTS-2 level. The use of ANN enabled the modeling of the non-linear relations associated with the complex structure of electricity demand. Satellite data were collected for the period 2013–2016, and included images with improved quality (inter alia higher resolution), compared to the DMSP/OLS program. As images are available from April 2012 onwards, it is only recently that their number has become sufficient for ANN learning. The images were used to create models of multilayer perceptrons. The results achieved by ANN were compared with the results obtained using linear regressions. Studies have confirmed that electricity consumption can be determined with higher precision by the ANN method."

abstract = "Accurate short-term wind power forecasting is significant for rational dispatching of the power grid and ensuring the power supply quality. In order to enhance the accuracy of short-term wind speed prediction, a hybrid model based on VMD-WT and PCA-BP-RBF neural network is proposed. In data pre-processing period, the non-stationary wind speed sequence is decomposed into a number of relatively stationary intrinsic mode functions (IMF) by variational mode decomposition (VMD); then WT algorithm is used to perform secondary denoising on each IMF. At the same time, several factors affecting wind speed are introduced, from which the input features that participated in the prediction are selected by PCA-BP method. Next, the RBF neural network is utilized to predict each IMF. Finally, all IMF prediction results are aggregated to obtain the final wind speed value. Combining the data of Spanish and Chinese wind farms, the experiment results show that: (1) compared with EMD, VMD-WT can better solve the problems of modal aliasing and endpoint effect, which can make the periodic characteristics of each IMF more obvious, then promote the forecasting performance; (2) using PCA-BP method to filter the model input data, the redundant and irrelevant information is eliminated, the complexity of the model is reduced, and the predictive performance of RBF model is improved; (3) compared with other traditional models, the hybrid model proposed in this paper has greatly improved the accuracy in short-term wind speed forecasting."

abstract = "An accurate and effective air quality index (AQI) forecasting is one of the necessary conditions for the promotion of urban public health, and to help society to be sustainable notwithstanding the effects of air pollution. This study proposes a hybrid AQI forecasting model to enhance forecasting accuracy. Variational mode decomposition (VMD) was applied to decompose the original AQI series into different sub-series with various frequencies. Then, sample entropy (SE) was applied to recombine the sub-series to solve the issues of over-decomposition and computational burden. Next, a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network was established, to forecast those new sub-series, following which the ultimate AQI forecast could be obtained, by accumulating prediction values from each sub-series. The results illustrated that: (1) the proposed VMD-SE-LSTM model displayed superior capacity for daily urban AQI forecasting, as shown using test case data from Beijing and Baoding; (2) when the proposed model was compared with other models, the results indicated that VMD-SE-LSTM model comprehensively captured the characteristics of the original AQI series. Besides, the proposed model had a high rate of correct AQI class forecasting, which existing single models cannot achieve, while other hybrid models can only reflect AQI series trends with limited prediction accuracy."
