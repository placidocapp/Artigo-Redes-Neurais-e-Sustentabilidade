abstract = "The development of Africa including industrialization such as chemical production, urbanization, agriculture, waste disposal, and electric power generation has a direct and diverse effect on the environment. These activities require effective planning, consultation, evaluation, risk assessment and monitoring techniques. Diverse environmental impacts can arise out of planning, construction, operation, and end-life of such activities. Impacts of global climate change, photochemical smog, and radioactive emissions have a direct link to development projects. Nevertheless, there is intensive research and innovation geared towards integrating development activities and the environment so as to achieve sustainable development. Herein, we review some of the technological innovation breakthroughs in various fields that include the built environment, chemical production, toxicants, municipal wastes, and electricity. The concept of sustainable chemistry is also discussed. It is found that Africa is at an advantage towards achieving sustainable development as it can easily adopt refined technological tools from developed countries. For instance, the use of comprehensive strategic environmental assessment tools for proposed policies plans and programs and environmental impact assessment for projects can see Africa achieve sustainable development. Mitigation measures for problems such as hazardous waste from chemical industries can be minimized using technological tools such as incineration of solid wastes, biological treatment of wastewater, batch and semi-batch conventional distillation, entrainer-based distillation, physical adsorption, and extraction etc. However, it is noted that although Africa should adopt some of these technological tools to help accelerate its sustainable development agenda, regional and cultural differences must be incorporated in the adoption process."

abstract = "The regional sustainable development level (SDL), sustainability of regional development (SRD) and system coordination (SC) make up the triangular truss of regional sustainable development assessment, but it is debated how should traditional practice best weight and calculate the whole sustainable development system level. The Bohai Rim, covering three provinces and two municipalities in China, lies in a region that is sensitive to profound conflict between socioeconomic development and environment pollution in the process of sustainable development. Considering the defects of traditional models and the multidimensionality of regional sustainability issues, we proposed an integrated model of nonlinear principal component analysis and Gram Schmidt orthogonalization and presented a novel regional sustainable development assessment method and framework from three perspectives for the society–economy–environment system of the Bohai Rim region. The results show that: (a) the integration of nonlinear principal component analysis and Gram Schmidt orthogonalization can well remedy the defects of traditional methods and provide a more objective conceptual framework; (b) the sustainability of regional development and system coordination models graphically demonstrate the essence and connotation of a dynamic sustainable development system; (c) the empirical study demonstrated that the Bohai Rim region has experienced a distinct development period in which the SRD experienced a steady decline and the SDL and SC generally increased; (d) the coordination ability can be improved by a decline in the environmental sustainability, which reveals the importance of environment subsystem optimization; and (e) the weight distribution of variables demonstrates that the most significant factors affecting sustainable development are the indicators from the dimensions of people's standard of living, economic structure and environmental pollution. This study enriches the sustainable development assessment theory and methodology, and lays the foundation for further sustainable development research in the Bohai Rim region."

Green energy is clean sources of energy that have a lower environmental impact compared to conventional energy technology. Green energy plays a significant role in the strategic energy planning process for any country. Regarding energy resources, India plays an important part on the world scene. However, the energy systems of the different regions and territories varied on various parameters. Therefore, a detailed green energy planning for sustainable development has been studied extensively to find the most suitable common strategy for energy management to answer the following questions: (i) which approaches were predominantly applied in a particular region? (ii) Which evaluating criteria were paid more intentness to energy planning for sustainable development in that region? (iii) Is there any inadequacy of the approaches?. Various decision-making strategies, integrated approaches, combined methods have proposed to characterize the energy management problem by different researchers. In modern power management, the performance of different green energy is evaluated against multiple criteria rather than considering a single factor-consumption. This paper reviews the various work on distinct approaches, integrated approaches, multi-criteria decision-making methods, etc., for green energy planning and scheduling problem. This research not only provides confirmation that the energy management strategies are better than the traditional methods, but also aids the researchers and decision makers in applying the procedures."

abstract = "Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from urban office buildings energy usages (BEC) constitute a substantial component of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emission, and are set to rapidly increase with further urbanization. Establishing a concise, accurate, and realistic model that can predict future emissions is challenging but essential for strategies to develop low carbon construction and sustainable development in urban areas. In this paper, the operational energy use for 294 office buildings across China was collected and analyzed. We focus on four main variables, and analyze a further ten second-level variables, to elucidate the role that a building’s occupants, its structural characteristics, and localized natural conditions play in determining energy consumption. Using general regression neural network (GRNN), the factors’ direct and indirect effects on energy consumption were tested. A building’s structural attributes had the most impact on energy-related CO2 emissions, followed by the relevant socioeconomic conditions, the micro-climate, and finally the regional climate. A version of the model that was constructed with interaction between the four main variables was found to be the most precise. GRNN combined with urban development scenarios was used for the prediction of cities’ future CO2 emissions. Economic development and improving standards in the construction industry could have significant impacts on future CO2 emissions. This study provides a detailed method that could be used to explore the dynamics of office energy use and competing options for the construction of low-carbon office buildings."

The paper interrogates an Irish government funded sustainable energy financed scheme (the ‘Greener Homes Scheme’), launched in 2006 and aimed at the deployment of low carbon technology in the residential sector. This paper analyses 31,560 technology installations supported under this scheme and it utilises artificial neural network modelling as a method of better analysing and understanding the effects, relationships and dependencies that influence consumer decision making and responses to new technological policies. It is responding to a perceived limited understanding of the variables that influence a wider adoption of low carbon technologies and the opportunities and potential that could result in a wider appreciation of the broader impact of market barriers. It builds up on the artificial neural networks modelling work, explores its application in pattern recognition and interprets its influence in predicting customer behaviour. The paper provides an enhanced understanding of the various factors that influence consumer selection of one low carbon technology over another. Evaluation of the results revealed that the developed artificial neural network model (generic 7-6-4 neurons layered architecture) is the most appropriate tool and suitable network in predicting indices, based on certain social conditions, on the choice of certain low carbon technologies."

Accordingly, six annual hourly consumption variables, reported by Iran’s power industry from 2011 to 2017, are predicted using seven dynamic and intelligent models. Consequently, technical and economic variables are obtained by an optimal design of hybrid solar, wind, and biogas systems at 53 sites in Iran. Thirteen social variables are studied using a technique for order-preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) and six hazardous air pollutants are reported in Iran using a geographic information systems interpolation tool. Then, four major TESEMA variables are used in multivariate statistical analyses to reduce the big data diversity. Principal component analysis (PCA) is performed to find a linear model among the variables, and K nearest neighborhood (KNN) algorithm is used to cluster the sites according to the modeling results. A partial least square-based regression is conducted to investigate any correlation between major variables of TESEMA and population density in Iran. Finally, TESEMA development index (DI) and facial graphs are proposed as novel numerical and graphical sustainable development monitoring techniques, respectively. The results show that DNN is the best model to predict demand load in Iran (RMSE = 73.15%). Since DI varies in a wide range from 0 to 248.83 and the population density is significantly correlated with TESEMA variables (R2 = 91.86%), the current centralistic policies should be revised in Iran to reach sustainable development. Thus, a four-cluster management strategy accompanied by smart monitoring can efficiently lead to sustainable development in Iran."

abstract = "The efficient use of resources is a relevant research topic for integrated steelworks. Process off-gases, such as the ones produced during blast furnace operation, are valid substitutes of natural gas, as they are sources of a considerable amount of energy. Currently they are recovered but sometimes part of such gas is flared due to non-optimal management of such resource. In order to exploit the off-gases produced in an integrated steelworks, the interactions between gas producers and users in the whole gas network need to be considered. The paper describes a model exploited by a Decision Support Tool that is under development within a European project. Such model forecasts the blast furnace gas amount and its heating power by obtaining an error between 3 and 7 % in a time horizon of 2 hours. The forecasted values of blast furnace gas allow a continuous optimal planning of the blast furnace gas usage according to its availability and to the needs in the steelworks, by avoiding losses of a valuable secondary resource and related emissions."

The added value of the information of the neighbouring PV systems has demonstrated to further improve the accuracy of predictions for both winter and summer seasons.

Such an estimation would help to further evaluate process control strategies and optimize overall operation of the electric arc furnace. The multilayer perceptron architecture 5-5-1 with hyperbolic tangent function in the hidden layer and linear function in the output layer was used as an optimal neural network model. The model was built, tested and validated based on experimental melts of the electric arc furnace at a melt shop in Italy. The proposed model was presented as an adequate one based on the coefficient of determination (R2) which was above 0.9 as well as other error parameters calculated. The highest effect on the electrical energy consumption has carbon content."

The results indicate significant variations in these issues across respondents’ sex, religion, past visitation to nature reserve (s) and environmental club membership.

Geography has integrated these artificial intelligence techniques, but not with the same enthusiasm. The main reason for hesitation is that ANNs are still confronted as complex and black boxes. However, ANNs might be more solid methods than conventional approaches when dealing with complex geographical problems. This study considers the great potential of ANNs for research in urban geography. First, using the PRISMA protocol, it provides a statistical review of 140 papers on studies that employed ANNs in urban geography between 1997 and 2016. Second, it performs a quantitative meta-analysis using non-parametric bootstrapping. 45 (of the 140) papers were assessed regarding ANNs' overall accuracy (OA) achieved when used for urban growth prediction or urban land-use classification. Third, a new guideline for reporting ANNs is proposed. Statistical review indicated that ANNs performed better in 75.7% of case studies compared to conventional methods. Meta-analysis found that on bootstrapped averages, the median OA achieved when using, ANNs was higher than the median OA achieved by other techniques by 2.3% (p < .001). ANNs also performed better when used for classification compared to prediction. Analysis also identified inadequate presentation of ANNs and related results when used in urban studies. For this reason, a new guideline for reporting ANNs is suggested in this work to ensure consistency and easier dissemination of individual lessons learned. These findings aim to motivate further studies on ANNs and deep learning in urban geography."

Here, a methodology is developed to quantify not only these three activities simultaneously but also link them to the urban form. Two development scenarios (densification and expansion) are proposed for the village Hemberg in Switzerland for the years 2030 and 2050. The results show that, with reference to 2017, global warming increases the cooling demand of the buildings by 70% in 2030 and by 115% in 2050. The results also suggest that renovation is the key element for the future energy management and efficiency improvement in Hemberg because the building insulation has much greater effect on the energy demand than the urban form. Furthermore, the results suggest that a grid-integrated energy hub consisting of wind turbines and PV panels can supply 77% of the annual energy demand in 2050. Also, urban form has great effects on building-integrated PV generation and, in general, on the integration of renewable technologies. The results contribute to efficient energy planning and policy-making for the future energy transition in Hemberg."
