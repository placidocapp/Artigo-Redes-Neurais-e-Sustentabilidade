Accurate and reliable groundwater level forecasting models can help ensure the sustainable use of a watershed’s aquifers for urban and rural water supply. In this paper, a new method based on coupling discrete wavelet transforms (WA) and artificial neural networks (ANN) for groundwater level forecasting applications is proposed. The relative performance of the proposed coupled wavelet–neural network models (WA–ANN) was compared to regular artificial neural network (ANN) models and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models for monthly groundwater level forecasting. The variables used to develop and validate the models were monthly total precipitation, average temperature and average groundwater level data recorded from November 2002 to October 2009 at two sites in the Chateauguay watershed in Quebec, Canada. The WA–ANN models were found to provide more accurate monthly average groundwater level forecasts compared to the ANN and ARIMA models. The results of the study indicate the potential of WA–ANN models in forecasting groundwater levels. It is recommended that additional studies explore this proposed method, which can be used in turn to facilitate the development and implementation of more effective and sustainable groundwater management strategies."

abstract = "Increasing energy consumption has led to release of pollutants such as greenhouse gases that affects on human health, agriculture, natural ecosystems, and earth temperature. Accurate estimation and forecasting of renewable energy is vital for policy and decision-making process in energy sector. This paper presents an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approach for optimum estimation and forecasting of renewable energy consumption by considering environmental and economical factors. The ANN trains and tests data with Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) approach which has the lowest mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The proposed approach is particularly useful for locations where there are no available measurement equipments. To show the applicability and superiority of the proposed ANN approach, monthly available data were collected for 11 years (1996–2006) in Iran. Complete sensitivity analysis is conducted to choose the best model for prediction of renewable energy consumption. The acquired results have shown high accuracy of about 99.9%. The results of the proposed model have been compared with conventional and fuzzy regression models to show its advantages and superiority. The outcome of this paper provides policymakers with an efficient tool for optimum prediction of renewable energy consumption. This study bypasses previous studies with respect to several distinct features."

abstract = "The Conferences on Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems (SDEWES) at the beginning of the 21st century have become a significant venue for researchers to meet, and initiate, discuss, share, and disseminate new ideas in various disciplines of sustainable development. In 2002, the first conference was organised in Dubrovnik, Croatia and since then, 10 more successful conferences were realised. Following the success of international conferences in Dubrovnik, the organizing committees decided to organize the main conference and regional conferences all over the world in even years. In 2016, the second regional SDEWES conference, namely the 2nd South East European Conference on Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems, was held June 15–18 in Piran/Portorose, Slovenia while the 11th SDEWES conference was organised in Lisbon, Portugal on September 4–8. There were 10 special sessions dedicated to various sustainability topics organised in both conferences. This special issue is based primarily upon a collection of 35 papers selected from among 538 scientific contributions presented at the 2nd SEE and 11th SDEWES Conferences. Moreover, this editorial summarises SDEWES published articles that have addressed and identified problems or provided the background for the research that is reported in the current special issue. The main topics of the selected papers address sustainable combustion technologies, renewable energy sources and sector integration, including the integration of renewable technologies in the urban environment, the integration of heat, cold, electricity and fuel production in buildings and industrial applications, heat exchangers and heat exchanger networks, the development and integration of energy storage for concentrated solar power plants, and sectorial integration of bioenergy resources and biorefineries with a particular focus on system integration for efficient and low-carbon systems."

Initially, 11 input parameters for all the three locations were used except DO at the downstream, then, 7 input for middle and downstream except DO at the target location and finally the downstream location was considered in the analysis. The performance was evaluated using determination coefficient (DC) and root mean square error (RMSE), the result of DO showed that both the ANN and ANFIS can be applied in modelling DO concentration in Agra city, and also indicate that, ANN model is slightly better than ANFIS and also indicates a considerable superiority to MLR."

These artificial neural networks (ANNs) with different architectures are trained using the Levenberg–Marquardt (LM) back-propagation algorithm and a cross validation is also performed to ensure that the results generalise to other unseen datasets. A rigorous study is carried out on optimally choosing the number of hidden layers, number of neurons in the hidden layer and activation function in a network using multiple Monte Carlo runs. Nine input and three output parameters are used to train and test various neural network architectures in both multiple output and single output prediction paradigms using the available experimental datasets. The model selection procedure is carried out to ascertain the best network architecture in terms of predictive accuracy. The simulation results show that the ANN based methodology is a viable alternative which can be used to predict the performance of a fluidized bed gasifier."

abstract = "Long term measurements of the amount of solar energy at ground level are not easily possible in many locations. Therefore, using empirical relations and recently applying Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are common means for prediction of the available solar energy at desired areas. Recent studies indicate that the performance of ANN provides better prediction than empirical relations. In former researches about ANN modeling of solar energy for some geographical locations, the parameters such as maximum and minimum daily temperature, relative humidity and wind speed were considered as the input of the soft computing. In present Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) ANN modeling, the amount of suspended Particulate Matters (PM10 and PM2.5) in the atmosphere is also added to the soft computation input. This ANN modeling strategy is used for estimating the amount of daily absorption of global solar radiation (both beam and diffuse radiation) on the land surface of Tehran (Longitude 51.23N and Latitude 35.44E) during a year. Furthermore, Indexes of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Absolute Fraction of Variance (R2) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) are used for accuracy evaluation of modeling results."
