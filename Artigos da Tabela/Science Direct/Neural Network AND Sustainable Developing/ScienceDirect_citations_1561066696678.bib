abstract = "Summary
A neural network model is applied to simulate the rainfall-runoff relation of a karst spring. The input selection for such a model becomes a major issue when deriving a parsimonious and efficient model. The present study is focused on these input selection methods; it begins by proposing two such methods and combines them in a subsequent step. The methods introduced are assessed for both simulation and forecasting purposes. Since rainfall is very difficult to forecast, especially in the study area, we have chosen a forecasting mode that does not require any rainfall forecast assumptions. This application has been implemented on the Lez karst aquifer, a highly complex basin due to its structure and operating conditions. Our models yield very good results, and the forecasted discharge values at the Lez spring are acceptable up to a 1-day forecasting horizon. The combined input selection method ultimately proves to be promising, by reducing input selection time while taking into account: (i) the model’s ability to accommodate nonlinearity and (ii) the forecasting horizon."

abstract = "Thailand is located in an equatorial belt that receives abundant solar energy. In order to achieve the optimum utilization of solar energy available, it is necessary to evaluate the incident solar radiation over the region of interest. Solar radiation can be assessed by means of measurements or mathematical modeling. Accurate measurements, using sophisticated and costly equipment, is available and has indeed been used extensively to assess solar radiation. This paper concentrates on an alternative approach to assess global solar radiation (GSR) by using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) together with classical observed meteorological data. The model is applied to the region of Bangkok, Thailand, using meteorological data, along with solar radiation measurements, for the period 2001-2010 from the Thai Meteorological Department (TMD). More precisely, three combinations of observed monthly mean meteorological data, i.e. maximum, minimum, and mean temperatures; relative humidity; rainfall amount; and sunshine hours were used with 3, 5 and 6 parameters as the model input for the ANN training to predict the solar radiation over the territory. A feed-forward back-propagation ANNs were trained based on three algorithms, i.e. the Quasi-Newton, the conjugate gradient with Polak-Ribiére updates and the Bayesian regularization. The root mean square error (RMSE) and the mean bias error (MBE) between the observed and the predicted solar radiations in 2011-2012 were computed in order to investigate the performance of the ANNs. Results showed that, for monthly mean number of sunshine hours in the range of 3.58 to 9.55 hr/day, the monthly mean GSR above the atmosphere of Bangkok was in the range of 5.64 to 22.53MJ/m2/day. The RMSE and the MBE were 0.0031 - 0.3632 and -0.0203 - 0.003, respectively, thus indicating that the ANN modeling has sufficient performance to predict the monthly mean GSR over an area where classical meteorological data are measured."

abstract = "As a clean and renewable energy source, wind energy has been increasingly gaining global attention. Wind speed forecast is of great significance for wind energy domain: planning and design of wind farms, wind farm operation control, wind power prediction, power grid operation scheduling, and more. Many wind speed forecasting algorithms have been proposed to improve prediction accuracy. Few of them, however, have studied how to select input parameters carefully to achieve desired results. After introducing a Back Propagation neural network based on Particle Swam Optimization (PSO-BP), this paper details a method called IS-PSO-BP that combines PSO-BP with comprehensive parameter selection. The IS-PSO-BP is short for Input parameter Selection (IS)-PSO-BP, where IS stands for Input parameter Selection. To evaluate the forecast performance of proposed approach, this paper uses daily average wind speed data of Jiuquan and 6-hourly wind speed data of Yumen, Gansu of China from 2001 to 2006 as a case study. The experiment results clearly show that for these two particular datasets, the proposed method achieves much better forecast performance than the basic back propagation neural network and ARIMA model."
