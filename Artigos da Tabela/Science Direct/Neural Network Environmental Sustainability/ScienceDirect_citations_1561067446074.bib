abstract = "This study estimated energy use flow of buffalo farms, energy use indices, production efficiency, energy use targets, impact of energy inputs on energy output, and sensitivity analysis of energy inputs. A well-structured questionnaire was used to collect data of 360 domestic buffalo farms from Punjab Pakistan during May-July, 2017. Results revealed that milk production was mainly dependent on renewable energy inputs, particularly millet, minerals, concentrates, and sorghum. Energy use efficiency (0.08) and production efficiency (0.24) indicate that energy inputs were overused. An artificial neural network (ANN) method suggested that 30.5% of total energy input could be saved if farmers followed the targeted inputs recommended by ANN. The Cobb-Douglas production function found a negative significant impact of sorghum, millet, and wheat straw; and positive significant impact of labour, concentrates, and electricity on energy output. Among the non-renewable energy sources, electricity was found to be the most wasteful use of energy input, mainly due to the mismanagement of farmers. Sensitivity analysis estimated that a unit increase in renewable energy significantly decreased milk yield by 0.02 unit. While a unit increase in non-renewable energy significantly increased milk yield by 0.01 unit. This study stresses the importance of using energy inputs at the target quantities prognosticated by ANN method, and recommends the use of energy-efficient equipment."

At the Mediterranean level, the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) has highlighted the importance of reversing the observed declining trend of fish stocks. In this complex context, it is important to obtain reliable biomass estimates to support scientifically sound advice for sustainable management of marine resources. This paper presents a machine learning methodology for the classification of pelagic species schools from acoustic and environmental data. In particular, the methodology was tuned for the recognition of anchovy, sardine and horse mackerel. These species have a central role in the fishing industry of Mediterranean countries and they are also of considerable importance in the trophic web because they occupy the so-called middle trophic level. The proposed methodology consists of a classifier based on an optimized two layer feed-forward neural network. Morphological, bathymetric, energetic and positional features, extracted from acoustic data, are used as input, together with other environmental data features. The classifier uses an optimal number of neurons in the hidden layer, and a feature selection strategy based on a genetic algorithm. Working on a dataset of 2565 fish schools, the proposed methodology permitted us to identify the these three fish species with an accuracy of around 95%."

Nine parameters that play an essential role in contributing to carbon emissions intensity were selected as input variables. The input parameters are economic growth, energy consumption, R&D, financial development, foreign direct investment, trade openness, industrialisation, and urbanisation. The study used quarterly data which span over the period 1980Q1-2015Q4 to develop, train and validate the models. To ensure the reproducibility of the results, twenty simulations were performed for each country. After numerous iterations, the optimal models for each country were selected based on predefined criteria. A 9-5-1 multi-layer perceptron with back-propagation algorithm was sufficient in building the models which have been trained and validated. Results from the validated models show that the predicted versus actual values indicate approximately zero errors along with higher coefficients of determination (R2) of 0.80 for Australia, 0.91 for Brazil, 0.95 for China, 0.99 for India and 0.87 for USA. The Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient (PRCC) results reveal that for Australia, R&D has the highest sensitivity weight while for Brazil and the USA, urbanisation has the highest sensitivity weight. For China, population size has the highest sensitivity weight while energy consumption has the highest sensitivity weight in India. The ANN models presented in this study have been validated and reliable to predict the growth of CO2 emission intensity for Australia, Brazil, China, India, and USA with negligible forecasting errors. The models developed from this study could serve as tools for international organisations and environmental policymakers to forecast and help in climate change policy decision-making."

The objective of this article is to apply artificial intelligence technology to evaluate environmental influence of cutting process and develop a decision support tool for selecting the optimal environmental solution from various alternative schemes. There are three stages to accomplish this assessment procedure. First, the evaluation index system of the cutting process was analyzed and established. Next, a training sample set which was used for learning the ‘knowledge and experience’ by neural networks, was acquired by kernel fuzzy clustering algorithm. Finally, an evaluation model based on a back-propagation neural network was constructed, and connection weights of the model were determined after training. A case research on the cutting processes of the automobile workpiece was conducted. Results showed that the proposed method is more concise and practicable than existing evaluation methods and provide a feasible and effective decision-making tool for selecting an optimal cutting process while manufacturing."

Opinions of real users about a large set of tables were used to train the model. The results of the study suggest that, using this procedure in advanced stages of product design process, designers can determine the set of product's physical attributes that best convey the idea of “environmentally sustainable” to the customer. The analysis of the obtained model allows establishing how different product's attributes influence users' perception. From these results, the utilization of users' affective response models to design the appearance of environmentally sustainable products is discussed."

This model is based on the prediction of CO2 emissions until 2050 taking into account the current Energy Policy of the EU. The results show that artificial neural networks model this system very well and that this model has the ability to predict the behaviour of CO2 emissions. This will also enable timely response and correction of energy and economic strategy by changing the value of the relevant indicators in order to achieve the ambitious planned reductions of CO2 emissions by 2050. These plans are specified in the Energy Roadmap 2050 document of the European Commission from 2012 and promote economically cost-effective scenarios that will adapt the European Union's economy to the needs of environmental protection and the reduction of energy consumption. Several structures of Artificial Neural Networks were analysed in order to select the best one for modelling large energy systems. It was determined that the model with the Cascade Forward Back Propagation structure with numerous specific indicators can model such energy systems and predict of CO2 emissions with acceptable accuracy."

In particular, we estimate the impact of these factors on Tobin's Q, which represents the overall technological and market strength of a firm as a forward-looking market performance reflecting stakeholders' expectations of the value of a firm. Using complementary regression and a neural network approach, we find that operational efficiency has the largest impact on Tobin's Q, followed by corporate reputation and environmental sustainability. In addition to its findings on the relative importance of these strategic factors, the paper's findings also suggest that operational efficiency, which reflects efficiency-driven best practice and managerial proficiency, is a crucial determinant of the market-facing measure of Tobin's Q in high-tech industries. Using models to estimate the interaction between these variables, we find that environmental sustainability and its interaction with reputation has the largest synergistic effect on Tobin's Q, followed by the interaction of reputation and operational efficiency. Our results show that the interaction of unique performance metrics can provide insights that differ from those derived from models for which the interaction is not included. Furthermore, the discovery of varying impact patterns under distinguishable capabilities is another significant finding of the paper."

Studies conducted thus far have covered mainly linear models. Most of case studies focused on single countries or groups of countries with only few focusing on the sub-national scale. This paper is pioneering in covering an area of Poland (Central Europe) at NUTS-2 level. The use of ANN enabled the modeling of the non-linear relations associated with the complex structure of electricity demand. Satellite data were collected for the period 2013–2016, and included images with improved quality (inter alia higher resolution), compared to the DMSP/OLS program. As images are available from April 2012 onwards, it is only recently that their number has become sufficient for ANN learning. The images were used to create models of multilayer perceptrons. The results achieved by ANN were compared with the results obtained using linear regressions. Studies have confirmed that electricity consumption can be determined with higher precision by the ANN method."

Grounding our investigation in the dynamic capability views and organisational culture and based on a sample of 205 Indian manufacturing organisations, we empirically investigate the effects of BDPA on social performance (SP) and environmental performance (EP) using variance based structural equation modelling (i.e. PLS). We find that BDPA has significant impact on SP/EP. However, we did not find evidence for moderating role of flexible orientation and control orientation in the links between BDPA and SP/EP. Our findings offer a more nuanced understanding of the performance implications of BDPA, thereby addressing the crucial questions of how and when BDPA can enhance social/environmental sustainability in supply chains."

abstract = "Increasing urbanization has been one of the most significant concerns of urban managers. The role of non-motorized transportation in sustainable urban development is vitally important for reducing overweight and obesity among citizens. These issues have led to numerous studies of the association between environmental characteristics, walkability index and levels of human health. The encouragement of public walking and cycling requires measures of walkability indices. One of the common challenges in measuring a walkability index is the complexity of the connection between the subjective indices resulting from public opinion and objective measures of geographic data. The scientific novelty of this paper lies in two aspects: First we developed and evaluated several artificial neural network (ANN) configurations for predicting subjective measures of walkability index from objective measures. Second, we introduced an index for two distinctive modes of walkability: daily shopping and recreation purposes that ranges from 1 to 10. The parameters of land-use diversity, population density, intersection density, network density, access to public transportation, green spaces and commercial places were utilized to calculate the objective value of the walkability index. The determination of subjective value of the walkability index was achieved using fieldwork reports. The resulting index was tested in districts 1 and 3 of Region 18 in the city of Tehran. The quantities used to evaluate the results included RMSE, MAE, MBE, and R. Network training was performed using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. A 10-fold cross validation was used to evaluate and compare the performance of different network configurations. Our findings indicated that the best walkability index for purchasing can be estimated using Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm with one hidden layer and seven neurons. This configuration resulted in a correlation coefficient and an RMSE of 93.79% and 0.1368 respectively. To predict the walkability index for recreational purpose, the best result was obtained using Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, representing a combination of one layer with four neurons for which the correlation coefficient and RMSE are 90.71% and 0.1602 respectively."
