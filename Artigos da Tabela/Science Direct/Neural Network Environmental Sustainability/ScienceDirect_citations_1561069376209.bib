abstract = "Sensitivity analysis establishes priorities for research and allows to identify and rank the most important factors which lead to great improvements in output factors. The aim of this study is to examine sensitivity analysis of inputs in grape production. We are proposing to perform sensitivity analysis using partial rank correlation coefficient (PRCC) which is the most reliable and efficient method, and we apply this for the first time in crop production. This research investigates the use of energy in the vineyard of a semi-arid zone of Iran. Energy use efficiency, energy productivity, specific energy and net energy were calculated. Various artificial neural network (ANN) models were developed to predict grape yield with respect to input energies. ANN models consist of a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with seven neurons in the input layer, one and two hidden layer(s) with different number of neurons, and an output layer with one neuron. Input energies were labor, machinery, chemicals, farmyard manure (FYM), diesel, electricity and water for irrigation. Sensitivity analysis was performed on over 100 samples of parameter space generated by Latin hypercube sampling method, which was then fed to the ANN model to predict the yield for each sample. The PRCC between the predicted yield and each parameter value (input) was used to calculate the sensitivity of the model to each input. Results of sensitivity analysis showed that machinery had the greatest impact on grape yield followed by diesel fuel and labor."

abstract = "Dramatically increased societal demands on the municipal services that contradict environmental protection and information processing capability oriented to resource utilization efficiency suffer from opposing simultaneous requirements. The smart city provides better solutions for urban areas which are increasing at an unprecedented speed. This paper presents an empirical study carried out to assess and analyze the development pattern of 35 smart cities in China using the principal component analysis (PCA) and back propagation (BP) neural network techniques. The proposed PCA-BP neural network assessment processing model is applied with six dimensional factors and twenty-two operating indices. With the feature extraction and performance score calculated via PCA, BP neural network is adopted for city classification to recognize the development differences in smart cities. The results indicate that the factor-driven impetus evolves into innovation-driven impetus, narrowing the gap from the holistic perspective between the first and middle-ranking groups, while two middle-ranking groups show a similar upward trend in terms of developing a smart economy through sustainable productivity in innovative enterprises and high-tech industry. To some extent, in response to a similar improving trend in the application of smart services, a distinct advantage of an individual index can be a complementary offset to unapparent holistic highlighting the reception of the lowest average points. Unbalanced development exists in two subaverage groups that are deficient in the initial inventory of smart infrastructure and demands. A relatively large difference exists in the smart mobility index among cities, whereas the opposite case is found concerning the smart environment index. Finally, corresponding optimized development pattern are recommended for building a sustainable smart city."

abstract = "The Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the key components of the ICT infrastructure of smart sustainable cities as an emerging urban development approach due to its great potential to advance environmental sustainability. As one of the prevalent ICT visions or computing paradigms, the IoT is associated with big data analytics, which is clearly on a penetrative path across many urban domains for optimizing energy efficiency and mitigating environmental effects. This pertains mainly to the effective utilization of natural resources, the intelligent management of infrastructures and facilities, and the enhanced delivery of services in support of the environment. As such, the IoT and related big data applications can play a key role in catalyzing and improving the process of environmentally sustainable development. However, topical studies tend to deal largely with the IoT and related big data applications in connection with economic growth and the quality of life in the realm of smart cities, and largely ignore their role in improving environmental sustainability in the context of smart sustainable cities of the future. In addition, several advanced technologies are being used in smart cities without making any contribution to environmental sustainability, and the strategies through which sustainable cities can be achieved fall short in considering advanced technologies. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to review and synthesize the relevant literature with the objective of identifying and discussing the state-of-the-art sensor-based big data applications enabled by the IoT for environmental sustainability and related data processing platforms and computing models in the context of smart sustainable cities of the future. Also, this paper identifies the key challenges pertaining to the IoT and big data analytics, as well as discusses some of the associated open issues. Furthermore, it explores the opportunity of augmenting the informational landscape of smart sustainable cities with big data applications to achieve the required level of environmental sustainability. In doing so, it proposes a framework which brings together a large number of previous studies on smart cities and sustainable cities, including research directed at a more conceptual, analytical, and overarching level, as well as research on specific technologies and their novel applications. The goal of this study suits a mix of two research approaches: topical literature review and thematic analysis. In terms of originality, no study has been conducted on the IoT and related big data applications in the context of smart sustainable cities, and this paper provides a basis for urban researchers to draw on this analytical framework in future research. The proposed framework, which can be replicated, tested, and evaluated in empirical research, will add additional depth to studies in the field of smart sustainable cities. This paper serves to inform urban planners, scholars, ICT experts, and other city stakeholders about the environmental benefits that can be gained from implementing smart sustainable city initiatives and projects on the basis of the IoT and related big data applications."

The meaning of performance ratio is analyzed and the main affecting factors of the performance level for PV pumping system are also summarized. The second curvelet neural network is constructed combing the second curvelet transform and feed forward neural network, and the structure of second curvelet neural network is designed. The classification of training and testing samples are confirmed based on the improved grey clustering model, and the corresponding mathematical models are studied. The firefly algorithm is used to optimize the second curvelet neural network. The grey classifications of training samples are confirmed based on grey clustering, which are used to train the second curvelet neural network with different structure optimized by firefly with different parameters, and then the testing samples are used to carry out prediction analysis. Simulation results show that the second curvelet neural network has highest prediction precision and efficiency, which can correctly and efficiently predict the performance ratio of PV pumping system."

Based on the quantitative measure of sustainability that has been proposed in ENA, the current paper explores the competing relationship between environmental flow and socioeconomic water uses through network structure analysis, from which the sustainable network structure for environmental flow is defined. Through constructions of the sustainable water use network with Beijing from 1999 to 2002 and 2005 to 2007 as case studies, the sustainable network structure value in view of environmental flow for Beijing is decided here. This research can be served as the first attempt to investigate environmental flow and its competitive relationship with the other water use activities in view of network structure. These efforts will lay the foundation for future studies on water allocation, regulation and management."

Therefore, it is of practical significance to measure the success degree of smart growth plan. The current model is accompanied by some problems such as subjectivity, unable to prioritize each plan, and so on. In this paper, an evaluating model was established to scientifically measure and adjust the smart growth plan based on BP neural network and set pair analysis. In this model, an evaluating metric(I) was defined, which was obtained by multiplying the ability score(A) and the coordinative development index(C). Applied to city's current plan, the model can tell us how successful the current plan is for this city, thus on the basis of evaluating result, better new plans for the city in the future can be developed. Finally, the effects of the new plans for population, economy-environment- society were discussed based on Lokta-Volterra equations and the environmental Kuznets curve. A case study was presented in two cities, Karamay and Atlanta. The result showed that the current plan in Atlanta is more successful than that in Karamay, but both the two plans are moderately successful. According to the results, a series of new plans were proposed and their priorities were ranked, the result showed that Atlanta should give priority to urban greening while Karamay give priority to economic development, and the effect of the scientific intelligence growth plan is to expand city's environmental capacity, promote the fair competition between the foreign population and the local population, and improve the balanced node, making the environment damage smaller, society and economic grow better. The model provides powerful reference for cities in developed and developing countries to formulate smart growth plans, especially for developing countries."

Therefore, the objectives of the present research are as follows: 1) evaluate the fruit culture of the guava producers (Psidium guajava, L.) in Calvillo, Aguascalientes, Mexico; and 2) to show whether it is possible to detect key variables in SLM by using an artificial neural network to improve productivity. The study unit (SU) was located in the community of San Tadeo (21.917 °N and 102.701 °W) in the municipality of Calvillo, Aguascalientes. We considered a total of 430 ha established with this fruit and nine orchards that consisted of 9.05 ha, which is equivalent to 2.09% of the total area. Each hectare was randomly sampled, with a significance of 95% (α ≥ 0.05). The information was collected by using empirical field techniques and a questionnaire sent to the producers. The results revealed that the productive success of the SU is based on the knowledge and ability of the fruit farmers to take advantage of bioclimatic and biophysical conditions for guava cultivation. It was demonstrated in approximately 90% of the analyzed cases that the producer’s SLM was between regular and excellent. This result was confirmed by the index of edaphic adequacy (Iea), which was created by nine of thirteen variables measured in the field, that indicated in 47% of the orchards (OR), the edaphic condition is optimum (Iea = 0) or close to optimum (-0.2 ≥ Iea ≤ 0.2). In addition, by using a Multilayer Percetron (MLP), it was possible to detect two key aspects in the producers’ work: cava design (DC) and soil management (SM)."

This study addresses two limitations in the current state of practice in pavement management. First, because the evaluation of maintenance strategies has traditionally focused on economic and technical aspects, it neglects the environmental impact of maintenance decisions. Second, current management systems often provide a unique, optimised pavement maintenance strategy based on a specific objective(s) and constraint(s). The main objective of the study is to analyse the effect of including environmental aspects and funding availability in the design of maintenance strategies. To achieve this objective, the study followed a three-step methodology. First, this study reviews existing practices on pavement maintenance and the criteria considered to trigger the application of maintenance treatments and their effects on pavement condition. Then, maintenance strategies are optimised considering three levels of budgetary capacity and a sustainable evaluation which incorporates technical, economic, and environmental aspects over the pavement lifecycle. Finally, a case study dealing with an urban pavement network in Chile is analysed. Results obtained from this case study show that an increment of 2% in maintenance budget allows to account for more sustainable maintenance decisions, such as cold in-place recycling and full-depth slab repair, whose greenhouse gas emissions are lower than other alternatives. Results also show that functional asphalt overlay and microsurfacing are more recommended in flexible pavements when budgetary restrictions are low, whereas recommended treatments for rigid pavements exhibit small variability with budgetary restrictions."

Reclamation is needed to restore mined areas to an acceptable condition. This study uses ANN to monitor reclamation activities in small scale mining area. Landsat satellite images of study area (2007, 2011 and 2016), ground truth data and ESRI shapefile of the study area were used for the analyses. Two ANN classification methods, Unsupervised Self – Organized Mapping (SOM) and Supervised Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), were used for the classification of the satellite images. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) change maps were generated in order to help confirm where actual change had occurred and to what extent it had occurred. The results show disturbance and revegetation in the study area between 2007 and 2016. The Barelands/mined areas class increased by 60.4% and a decrease in the vegetation class by 18.7% from 2007 to 2011. There was revegetation from 2011 to 2016 with the Barelands/Mined Area decreasing by 51.7% and the vegetation increasing by 3.9%. The study shows an increase in the settlement class by 87.3%. The research concludes that the application of ANN be strongly encouraged for image classification and mine reclamation monitoring in the country due to the size and quality of training data, network architecture, and training parameters as well as the ability to improve the accuracy and fine tune information obtained from individual classes as compared to other classification methods."

This paper proposes a neural network approach to performance prediction of PV Modules. Here the feed forward neural networks are used to predict I-V curve parameters as a function on input irradiance and temperature. K Fold cross-validation is used to validate model accuracy for determination of I-V curve parameters for five different technology modules, i.e., CdTe, CIGS, MICROMORPH, MUTICRYSTALLINE, MAXEON. A comparison is also drawn between the neural network predictor and the existing modeling procedures available. Model parameters have been determined following iterative, analytical and regression of known data points for seven and five parameter model of PV Modules. Among the electrical equivalent models, the seven parameter model is the most efficient model for performance prediction however commutation of model parameters in complex and tedious. Neural network model simplifies the computational process at the expense of higher error variance in comparison to electrical equivalent models. Further, a cascade implementation of the above two is designed and tested on Multicrystalline and Maxeon technology modules for higher model accuracy. The results obtained, verify the proposed cascaded model to be the most efficient model in comparison to independent models where mean bias error deviations are less than ±1% and error variance is reduced significantly. Also, a MATLAB based graphical user interface (GUI) is developed that can be used to predict the performance based on the analysis carried out. The proposed model is tested against a set of operating conditions and compared to the actual experimental values obtained using outdoor tests."

Augmented reality is an emerging technology that blends three-dimensional virtual objects with reality. Technologies such as Augmented Reality can be useful tools to promote sustainable development in higher education in terms of various economic, social and environmental considerations. This paper aims to investigate faculty members’ awareness of the potential benefits of incorporating Augmented Reality technology in Saudi Arabian universities in terms of its economic and environmental sustainability. For this study, quantitative data was collected by means of a survey questionnaire where participants responded to statements on a five-point Likert scale that ranged from “totally agree” to “totally disagree”. The study was conducted with a sample comprising 228 academic and e-learning department staff from Saudi universities. The exploratory factor analysis technique was utilised to identify factors related to awareness of advantages of using Augmented Reality in education, particularly in relation to sustainability. Two factors were identified, namely environmental and economic factors. Study findings indicated that academic and e-learning department staff believe that the use of Augmented Reality in higher education has positional environmental and economic sustainability benefits. The findings from this study provide insights that will assist further studies regarding AR in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries."

Our optimization considered trade-offs among seven different objectives at different scales, including farm profits, irrigation water use, corn grain, corn stover, soil organic carbon (SOC), greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and nitrogen leaching. The results show that the surrogate captured greater than 99% of the variations in the DayCent’s simulated outputs and was 6.2 million times faster than the DayCent model for our analysis. Farm-level optimization increased farm profits by 83%–150%, SOC by 16%–53%, grain yield by 10.1–11.3%, and reduced GHG emissions by 19%–55% compared to the ‘business-as-usual’ scenario."
