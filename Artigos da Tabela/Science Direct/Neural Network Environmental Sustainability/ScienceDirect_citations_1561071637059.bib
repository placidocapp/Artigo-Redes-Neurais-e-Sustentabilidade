abstract = "In this paper, we analyze the impacts of the Carbon Neutral Growth from 2020 strategy (CNG2020 strategy) on airline environmental inefficiency based on the predicted data of 29 international airlines during 2021–2023. The data is predicted through BP neural network. Following the principle of CNG2020 strategy, we calculate the emission limit for each airline. Then we propose a new model, Network Range Adjusted Environmental DEA, to discuss the environmental inefficiency change between the conditions with CNG2020 strategy and without CNG2020 strategy. The main findings are: 1. Garuda Indonesia has the largest inefficiency during 2021–2023, while Singapore is the benchmarking airline with the best performance. 2. For most airlines, CNG2020 strategy has a positive impact on their efficiency improvement. 3. The decrease of operating expenses slacks and the feasible expansion of total revenue are the main reasons for inefficiency decrease."

Natural resources have been exploited unduly regardless of the consequences, which has resulted in inappropriate management natural resources and has caused severe environmental degradation. Contributions in this SV addressed improved environmental management, utilization, and allocation of natural resources; evaluation of sustainable natural resource management; pollution prevention and treatment; and evaluation and suggestions for improved natural resource-related policies. The authors presented an inspiring panorama of the initiatives that have been developed throughout the world for sustainable natural resource management and improve societal development. Theoretically, new approaches to bridge the gaps between the economic development and environmental protection were increasingly dominant. Empirically, many of the papers provided case studies of regions in China and other regions. The authorship reflected growing collaboration between researchers from many different countries or universities. While the great diversity of contributions on the topic reflected the wealth of insights generated on the topic in recent years, there is much more that must be done to achieve societal sustainability in natural resource management."

abstract = "Wind energy has attracted more attentions in recent decades as a green and sustainable electricity generation resource with little or no pollution. Fluctuations in output of wind turbines and their dependency on environmental conditions, however, limit their penetration into power grids. This research proposes a collaboration platform to overcome these challenges by collaboration among communities in the energy distribution network. First, a second order trigonometric regression model is applied to forecast energy demands, and a multiple linear regression model is used to predict energy output of a wind farm. Based on this information, communities in the network can initiate the collaboration process through the proposed platform, which is controlled by two collaboration protocols: Demand and Capacity Sharing Protocol (DCSP) and Best Matching Protocol (BMP). The protocols are applied to optimize communities' profit through matching the communities with excessive capacity with the ones with energy shortage so that they can create a sustainable distribution network. A simulation of three communities with three wind farms is conducted to measure the impact of the platform. The results show the sustainability of the energy network can be achieved by reduced demand loss and holding cost and improved collaborative capacity."

Street lighting system is one of the part of the facility provided in smart cities. The unwanted utilisation of the street lighting affects the economic status of the country indirectly. Power consumption through street lighting is major problem, hence action plan is taken to promote the reduction policies of the power consumption. Reducing the unnecessary power consumption is not a simple task, but with soft computing approaches power consumption can be reduced. The objective of this article is to present an ANN based energy efficient smart street lighting systems. The proposed design were implemented and executed in a residential area, Hosur and the results are carried out at different scenarios and various seasons. The decision making module exploits the analysis factors obtained via lighting sensor, motion sensor, PIR sensor, etc. artificial neural network and fuzzy logic controller makes an efficient decision making process for demand based utilisation and to avoid the unnecessary utilisation of street lights. The five levels of scenarios are tested and implemented in a real time. Through this work, the smart and energy efficiency street lighting system reduced the unwanted utilisation by 34% and reduced the power consumption rate of 13.5%."

abstract = "This study considered combinational control approaches for predicting electricity consumption in a building based on an optimized back-propagation (BP) neural network. Forecasting the electricity consumption of buildings is an important part of power management systems because it directly affects power dispatching and safe production. The BP neural network prediction method is used widely for this purpose because of its high plasticity and simple structure, but it has disadvantages such as slow convergence, fluctuations, and oscillation during training. We propose the use of the Levenberg–Marquardt back-propagation (LM-BP) neural network to enhance the accuracy of predictions by combining the gradient descent and Quasi-Newton method, thereby ensuring the fast convergence speed and maintaining better overall performance. Additionally, the network weights can be optimized by adaptive adjustment between the steepest gradient descent method and the Gauss–Newton method so the network can converge effectively. Hence, the accuracy and stability of the LM algorithm are improved, and a building electricity consumption prediction model can be established based on the improved BP neural network. Our results demonstrate that the forecasting model based on LM-BP neural network improves the accuracy and stability of predictions, and it is suitable for the short-term prediction of building electricity consumption."

abstract = "An accurate and effective air quality index (AQI) forecasting is one of the necessary conditions for the promotion of urban public health, and to help society to be sustainable notwithstanding the effects of air pollution. This study proposes a hybrid AQI forecasting model to enhance forecasting accuracy. Variational mode decomposition (VMD) was applied to decompose the original AQI series into different sub-series with various frequencies. Then, sample entropy (SE) was applied to recombine the sub-series to solve the issues of over-decomposition and computational burden. Next, a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network was established, to forecast those new sub-series, following which the ultimate AQI forecast could be obtained, by accumulating prediction values from each sub-series. The results illustrated that: (1) the proposed VMD-SE-LSTM model displayed superior capacity for daily urban AQI forecasting, as shown using test case data from Beijing and Baoding; (2) when the proposed model was compared with other models, the results indicated that VMD-SE-LSTM model comprehensively captured the characteristics of the original AQI series. Besides, the proposed model had a high rate of correct AQI class forecasting, which existing single models cannot achieve, while other hybrid models can only reflect AQI series trends with limited prediction accuracy."

However, the instability of wind power has a serious impact on a grid system. Reliable wind power forecasting will help to utilize storage systems and backup generators effectively for mitigating the instability. This paper proposes a feature extraction procedure for numerical weather prediction (NWP) data based on the three-dimensional convolutional neural networks (3D-CNNs). An advantage of 3D-CNNs is to automatically extract the spatio-temporal features from NWP data focusing on the targeted wind farm. Feature extraction based on 3D-CNNs was applied to real-world datasets; the results show significant performance in comparison to several benchmark approaches, and also show that the proposed extraction scheme based on 3D-CNNs achieves to derive intrinsic features for prediction of wind power generation from NWP data."
