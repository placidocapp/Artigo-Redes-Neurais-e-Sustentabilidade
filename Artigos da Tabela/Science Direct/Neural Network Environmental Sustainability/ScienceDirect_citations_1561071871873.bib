abstract = "This paper presents a review on the application of neural networks for the estimation, forecasting, monitoring, and classification of exogenous environmental variables that affect the performance, salubrity, and security of cities, buildings, and infrastructures. The forecast of these variables allows to explore renewable energy and water resources, to prevent potentially hazardous construction locations, and to find the healthiest places, thus promoting a more sustainable future. Five research themes are covered—solar, atmospheric, hydrologic, geologic, and climate change. The solar section comprises solar radiation, direct and diffuse radiation, infrared and ultraviolet radiation, clearness index, and sky luminance and luminous efficacy. The atmospheric section reviews wind, temperature, humidity, cloud classification, and storm prediction. The hydrologic section focuses on precipitation, rainfall-runoff, hail, snow, drought, flood, tides, water levels, and other variables. The geologic section covers works on landslides, earthquakes, liquefaction, erosion, soil classification, soil mechanics, and other properties. Finally, climate change forecasting and downscaling of climate models are reviewed. This work demonstrates the wide range of applications of these methods in different research fields. Some research gaps and interdisciplinary research opportunities are identified for future development of comprehensive forecast and evaluation approaches regarding the estimation of renewable energy and built environment-related variables."

abstract = "Ecological information offered to society through advertising enhances awareness of environmental issues, encourages development of sustainable attitudes and intentions, and can even alter behavior. This paper, by means of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and self-reports, explores the underlying mechanisms of processing ecological messages. The study specifically examines brain and behavioral responses to persuasive ecological messages that differ in temporal framing and in the age of the voice pronouncing them. The findings reveal that attitudes are more positive toward future-framed messages presented by young voices. The whole-brain analysis reveals that future-framed (FF) ecological messages trigger activation in brain areas related to imagery, prospective memories and episodic events, thus reflecting the involvement of past behaviors in future ecological actions. Past-framed messages (PF), in turn, elicit brain activations within the episodic system. Young voices (YV), in addition to triggering stronger activation in areas involved with the processing of high-timbre, high-pitched and high-intensity voices, are perceived as more emotional and motivational than old voices (OV) as activations in anterior cingulate cortex and amygdala. Messages expressed by older voices, in turn, exhibit stronger activation in areas formerly linked to low-pitched voices and voice gender perception. Interestingly, a link is identified between neural and self-report responses indicating that certain brain activations in response to future-framed messages and young voices predicted higher attitudes toward future-framed and young voice advertisements, respectively. The results of this study provide invaluable insight into the unconscious origin of attitudes toward environmental messages and indicate which voice and temporal frame of a message generate the greatest subconscious value."

Effects from the removal of policy income support are also evaluated. For this purpose, a Multilayer Feedforward Neural Network is applied to model farmers’ behaviour over the period 2003–2007. Results indicate that the choice of decoupling direct payments from production, compared with the hypothesis of maintaining the previous policy regime, allowed a reduction in the use of chemicals in the regional case analysed. Positive environmental effects were relatively higher in farms that introduced crops only for obtaining short-term gains. Moreover, results show that the total removal of direct payments would have brought about stronger environmental benefits than decoupling, by pushing the most penalised farmers to reorient their production towards alternative activities."

abstract = "Presence of optimal levels of dissolved oxygen (above critical level of 4.5 mg L−1) and presence of zooplankton community are indicators of good water quality of an aquatic ecosystem and also of the health of the same. Reservoirs being artificially created water bodies present hybrid systems containing features of both lotic and lentic systems and thus have unique organization that are representative of both rivers and lakes. Since any reservoir is primarily a fresh water system, presence of a large array of zooplankton (diverse community structure) implies its good health and also presence of optimal dissolved oxygen levels supports sustenance of life. In this study, artificial neural network modelling approach has been utilized to predict the level of dissolved oxygen and zooplankton abundance in the Bakreswar reservoir and their variation in relation to the environmental factors. Use of neural network modelling is exceedingly capable of determining correlation among apparently non correlated environmental data and in the current study these are capable of accurately predicting the variations in the levels of dissolved oxygen as well as the abundance of zooplankton. From this study, it has been observed that chemical factors like productivity, nitrates, salinity, pH, phosphates, total dissolved solids, etc. are mostly responsible for control of dissolved oxygen and zooplankton variation at certain points of the study site (stations 1 and 3) whereas at other points (station 2) physical factors like solar radiation, humidity, etc. are more effective. These models are capable of finding the important environmental controllers of such variations and prove to be a powerful alternative to traditional approaches like multiple regression analysis."

A small-world topology configuration is used for the metric network, and compared with a configuration obtained from the Mutual Information (MI) between companies, in terms of the usual dilution and shortcut ratios. The resulting MI topology configuration is depicted for mesoscopic blocks distributed by continents and economic sectors. The reporting sequence is learned as static patterns, as well as, a temporal sequence from year 1999 to 2013. The retrieval of the sequence showed a saturation point around 2010 where the reporting pattern stalled. We showed that the MI topology configuration obtained for continents, reinforces previous research about the role of Europe as a driver about sustainability and its influence worldwide. Also, the MI configuration outlines recent (post-crises) behavior, of the involved economic sectors."

Then the linear autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and non-linear artificial neural network (ANN) models are applied to predict future ecological security. The results show that: (1) The per capita EF increased by three times from 1978 to 2013, whereas the per capita ecological carrying capacity experienced only a slight increase although the equivalence and yield factors were both enhanced. (2) The ‘degree of ecological security’ appeared to show a tendency to increase, indicating that China is in a ‘pretty unsafe’ ecological state. (3) EF intensity, which is used to represent the resource consumption level corresponding to unit economic output, indicated that the utilisation ratio of Chinese natural resources was greatly enhanced during the study period. (4) The ecological footprint diversity index, and ecological and economic coordination coefficient, peaked in the 1990s and then began to fall, indicating that China's ecological environment, as well as its coordination with the economy, was considered to be better in the 1990s but then gradually deteriorated. (5) The predictions of ARIMA–ANN model indicated that the degree of ecological security in China would reach an unsafe state in a few years if certain effective measures were not taken. These findings could be helpful for decision-makers as they strive to make a better package of plans to ensure an ecological balance and a more sustainable future."

After nearly 30 years’ development, a general cartography of existing research is now needed to reflect the major ideas and questions involved. This is carried out here by a bibliometric analysis. Following a basic review of the evolutionary progress of “green manufacturing” and similar concepts, we collect articles concerning green manufacturing, environmentally conscious/responsible manufacturing, benign manufacturing, and sustainable manufacturing. The data sources are limited to SCI and SSCI journals. Then we extract high frequency keywords from the articles and calculate their co-occurrence. A hierarchical clustering is conducted based on the co-word matrix, and six clusters are identified and visually presented by a strategic diagram and bi-dimensional multi-dimensional scaling diagrams. The six clusters cover the research subjects of green chemical materials, green manufacturing principles and approaches, common analytical tools, green manufacturing implementation of industrial firms, green supply chain, industrial ecology, GHG emissions, and green machining tools and processes. We build a framework to embed the green manufacturing system into the economic-social-eco system and divide green manufacturing research into three levels: application, organization, and system. Based on this framework, we combine the existing research architecture and research boundaries in the field and propose possible future research directions."

abstract = "This paper proposes an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict the solar energy generation produced by photovoltaic generators. The intermittent nature of solar power creates two main issues. Firstly, power production and demand have to be balanced to ensure the control of the whole system, and the inherent variability of clean energies makes this difficult. Secondly, energy generation companies need a highly accurate day-ahead or intra-day estimation of the energy to be sold in the electricity pool. For the tool developed in this paper, we address the issue of the complexity of control in systems that are based on solar energies. The tool's ability to predict the parameters that are involved in solar energy production will allow us to estimate the future power production in order to optimise grid control. Our tool uses an ANN which we developed using MATLAB® software. The results were validated by analysing the root mean square error of the prediction for days outside the database used for training the ANN. The difference between the actually produced and predicted energy is about 0.5–9%, meaning that the accuracy of our tool is sufficient enough to be installed in systems which have integrated solar generators."

abstract = "The stochastic character of wind power generation suggests limitations on the increased shares of wind energy in electricity systems and challenges market integration of wind power, mainly due to the fact that nowadays, new wind parks are set to cope with more dynamic pricing mechanisms. In this new environment, where advanced bidding strategies need to be adopted from wind power actors, the introduction of novel elements to support wind power generation and address the inherent impact of variability is thought to be a prerequisite. To this end, the current study expands the work of previous studies by examining different methods of prediction with regards to wind power forecasting. More specifically, both Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) models are trained and tested on the basis of different prediction horizons, using as case study real wind speed and wind power generation measurements from a wind park operating in the Greek territory. Models are trained using an in-house forecasting tool, with results obtained reflecting the better fit of the SVR method overall, especially for time horizons longer than 6 hours ahead. At the same time, an effort is made in order to optimize prediction of wind power generation through the combination of both prediction approaches via clustering of prediction areas. This novel approach results in an improvement of the predictions obtained, despite the fact that the SVR method already performs sufficiently even for 24 hours ahead."
