abstract = "For decades, maintenance of facilities and equipment, as well as related activities (from fault detection to prognostics and health management), has a proven impact on efficiency of production systems and is thus still the subject of numerous developments (from corrective to proactive maintenance). These developments are supported by the increase in digital pervasiveness accompanying the Industry 4.0. concept, based in particular on the use of Cyber-Physical Systems. In addition, we are witnessing the growing interest of the political and academic world and public opinion with regard to the sustainable impact of human activity. For company decision-makers, triple bottom line accounting frameworks have been introduced at higher decision levels (strategic) based on economic, social, and environmental performance indicators. This triple preoccupation has not yet been integrated into studies on middle (tactical) and lower (operational) decision levels, and paradoxically, not into production facility health management either. In this paper, we propose the deployment of a framework helping decisions makers to be environmentally aware in the maintenance of cyber physical systems. This framework consists of three key elements: a new maintenance policy called Sustainable Condition-Based Maintenance (SCBM), which requires the assessment of the Remaining Sustainable Life (RSL) as a key indicator; an adaptation and extension of a generic prognostic business process initially proposed for traditional Conditions Based Maintenance (CBM); and an organization adapted to the prognosis of the environmental performance of systems, based on holonic structures. We present the implementation of such a framework on a real Cyber Physical Systems under development."

abstract = "With our attitudes and behavior, which aim at promoting sustainable behavior, we face a temporal dilemma – a temporal conflict between short-term and long-term interests. Accordingly, psychological time is an essential variable in understanding how people decide between options of short-term self-interest, which can be experienced at present, and long-term common interest, such as sustainable development with an outcome that lies far in the future. Present feelings are often so powerful that considerations of future events are neglected. Individuals differ in their emphasis on present and future dimensions. A stronger future orientation and a mindful present orientation are positive predictors of sustainable behavior; hedonistic and impulsive present orientations are negative predictors. We discuss the concept of the balanced time perspective as the propensity to consciously switch among the time orientations of past, present, and future. Fitting with their overall psychological profile, individuals with a balanced time perspective might display a range of sustainable attitudes and behaviors."

SWM approaches have been modified into a more practical and effective option to establish sustainability based on the “reduce”, “reuse”, and “recycle” (3R) principles. This review provides an overview of a wide range of existing SWM strategies with the following key objectives: (i) to comprehensively describe current technologies, strategic innovations, and monitoring tools, (ii) to provide an overview of prevailing waste management scenarios across different countries, (iii) to identify the roles of life cycle assessment (LCA) and other modeling tools in SWM, and (iv) to showcase feasible approaches for sustainable recycling and utilization of solid wastes. The current review finds that geographical positions and economic status of nations are important to dictate waste characteristics. A number of economic and LCA models have been described to facilitate future workers vis-à-vis organizations for the selection of appropriate waste management algorithms and for the evaluation of their eventual performance. In addition, this paper showcases various innovative solutions that have been reported for the achievement of smart and sustainable waste management plans in many countries."

abstract = "Accurate short-term wind power forecasting is significant for rational dispatching of the power grid and ensuring the power supply quality. In order to enhance the accuracy of short-term wind speed prediction, a hybrid model based on VMD-WT and PCA-BP-RBF neural network is proposed. In data pre-processing period, the non-stationary wind speed sequence is decomposed into a number of relatively stationary intrinsic mode functions (IMF) by variational mode decomposition (VMD); then WT algorithm is used to perform secondary denoising on each IMF. At the same time, several factors affecting wind speed are introduced, from which the input features that participated in the prediction are selected by PCA-BP method. Next, the RBF neural network is utilized to predict each IMF. Finally, all IMF prediction results are aggregated to obtain the final wind speed value. Combining the data of Spanish and Chinese wind farms, the experiment results show that: (1) compared with EMD, VMD-WT can better solve the problems of modal aliasing and endpoint effect, which can make the periodic characteristics of each IMF more obvious, then promote the forecasting performance; (2) using PCA-BP method to filter the model input data, the redundant and irrelevant information is eliminated, the complexity of the model is reduced, and the predictive performance of RBF model is improved; (3) compared with other traditional models, the hybrid model proposed in this paper has greatly improved the accuracy in short-term wind speed forecasting."

In this scenario, the accuracy of the forecasts and swiftness of the prediction process are the major factors. This paper presents an accurate and fast mechanism for wind forecasting up to six steps in future. Two different multi-step prediction strategies, namely, direct strategy and recursive strategy are used for this purpose. A nonlinear autoregressive neural network is developed to implement these techniques for wind speed time series. The developed method is evaluated in terms of standard performance indices via a thorough case study considering real-world wind speed data. The simulation results depict the efficacy of the proposed methodology as compared to a benchmark prediction model especially for longer time horizons."

abstract = "This study aims to evaluate landslide causative factors in landslide susceptibility assessments and to compare landslide susceptibility models based on the bivariate frequency ratio (FR), multivariate logistic regression (LR), and artificial neural network (ANN). The majority of landslide occurrences in Ambon, Indonesia is induced by heavy rainfall events where slope failures occur mostly on steep slopes thereby endangering municipality areas at the base of the hills. Eight landslide causative factors were considered in the landslide susceptibility assessments. The causative factors were elevation, slope angle, slope aspect, proximity to stream network, lithology, density of geological boundaries, proximity to faults, and proximity to the road network. The output susceptibility maps were reclassified into five classes ranging from very low to very high susceptibility using Jenks natural breaks method. Twenty percent of all mapped landslides were used as the validation of the susceptibility models. The validity and the accuracy of each model were tested by calculating areas under receiver operating characteristic curves (ROCs), and the areas under the curve (AUC) for the success rate curves of FR, LR, and ANN were 0.688, 0.687, and 0.734, respectively. The AUC for the prediction rate curve of FR, LR, and ANN were 0.668, 0.667, and 0.717, respectively. All findings of the models show good results with the accuracy of all models being higher than 66%. The ANN method proved to be superior in explaining the relationship of landslide with each factor studied."

The paper interrogates an Irish government funded sustainable energy financed scheme (the ‘Greener Homes Scheme’), launched in 2006 and aimed at the deployment of low carbon technology in the residential sector. This paper analyses 31,560 technology installations supported under this scheme and it utilises artificial neural network modelling as a method of better analysing and understanding the effects, relationships and dependencies that influence consumer decision making and responses to new technological policies. It is responding to a perceived limited understanding of the variables that influence a wider adoption of low carbon technologies and the opportunities and potential that could result in a wider appreciation of the broader impact of market barriers. It builds up on the artificial neural networks modelling work, explores its application in pattern recognition and interprets its influence in predicting customer behaviour. The paper provides an enhanced understanding of the various factors that influence consumer selection of one low carbon technology over another. Evaluation of the results revealed that the developed artificial neural network model (generic 7-6-4 neurons layered architecture) is the most appropriate tool and suitable network in predicting indices, based on certain social conditions, on the choice of certain low carbon technologies."

abstract = "Financial exploitation of forests comprises an important part of man activity. There are efforts being made to conserve the sustainable exploitation while simultaneously avoiding degradation of the environment. One tool used in these efforts is the modeling of tree features, such as total tree height, sawn-timber tree height, merchantable tree height, and total or sawn-timber tree volume, which yields an estimate of the forest in finance recoverable goods. Sustainable forest management design must be supported by the adjustment of computational techniques. The purpose of this paper is to assess a reliable modeling approach for estimating individual tree heights for the maturity of trees for logging through determining the applicability of different types of neural network models and identifying a neural network procedure for accurate estimation of these variables. These models serve as an alternative to the traditional regression approach. All types of model estimations are evaluated and compared in this paper. Back Propagation Artificial Neural Network (BPANN), Cascade Correlation Artificial Neural Network (CCANN), and Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN) models are developed to estimate individual tree heights for the logging of mature trees, such as sawn-timber height and merchantable height. The results reported in this research suggest that the selected BPANN and CCANN models are reliable and demonstrate their adequacy and potential for estimating sawn-timber and merchantable tree height. The results also illustrate that the CCANN models are superior to the BPANN and GRNN models and lead to higher estimation accuracy. Moreover, the NN models were found to be superior to the tested nonlinear regression models."
