abstract = "In the present study, sustainable development is investigated in Iran using renewable energies-assisted Techno-Econo-Socio-Environmental Multivariate Analysis (TESEMA) as a novel holistic approach. Accordingly, six annual hourly consumption variables, reported by Iran’s power industry from 2011 to 2017, are predicted using seven dynamic and intelligent models. Consequently, technical and economic variables are obtained by an optimal design of hybrid solar, wind, and biogas systems at 53 sites in Iran. Thirteen social variables are studied using a technique for order-preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) and six hazardous air pollutants are reported in Iran using a geographic information systems interpolation tool. Then, four major TESEMA variables are used in multivariate statistical analyses to reduce the big data diversity. Principal component analysis (PCA) is performed to find a linear model among the variables, and K nearest neighborhood (KNN) algorithm is used to cluster the sites according to the modeling results. A partial least square-based regression is conducted to investigate any correlation between major variables of TESEMA and population density in Iran. Finally, TESEMA development index (DI) and facial graphs are proposed as novel numerical and graphical sustainable development monitoring techniques, respectively. The results show that DNN is the best model to predict demand load in Iran (RMSE = 73.15%). Since DI varies in a wide range from 0 to 248.83 and the population density is significantly correlated with TESEMA variables (R2 = 91.86%), the current centralistic policies should be revised in Iran to reach sustainable development. Thus, a four-cluster management strategy accompanied by smart monitoring can efficiently lead to sustainable development in Iran."

To get more sustainable products, not only the technical and economic factors, but also the environmental factors should be considered. To satisfy the requirements, evaluation indicators of materials are presented. Environmental impacts were calculated by the Life Cycle Assessment method (LCA method). An integration of artificial neural networks (ANN) with genetic algorithms (GAs) is proposed to optimize the multi-objectives of material selection. It was validated by an example that the system can select suitable materials to develop sustainable products."

abstract = "This work develops an artificial neural network (ANN) model using genetic algorithms to estimate the annual amount (kg/inhabitant/year) of separately-collected household packaging waste. The ANN model comprises one input layer, one hidden layer with seven neurons and one output layer. Ten variables affecting the amount of separately-collected packaging waste were identified and used in the ANN model. These variables are related to the level of education of the population, the size and level of urbanisation of the municipality, social aspects related to poverty and economic power and factors intrinsic to the waste collection service. A comparison between ANN and regression models for the estimation of packaging waste is also carried out. The performance of the proposed ANN model for a data set of 42 municipalities located in the centre of Portugal, measured by the R2, is 0.98. This value is 34% higher than the best regression model applied to the same data set (R2 = 0.73), indicating that ANN has a significantly higher explanatory power than traditional regression techniques. Another advantage is that ANN is not as sensitive to outliers as regression. However, ANN is more complex, has a higher number of variables, and the model development and interpretation of the results are more difficult. Nevertheless, the higher performance of ANN makes it a valuable tool in the definition of strategies to increase recycling and achieve circular economy goals."

abstract = "This article presents a methodology for the construction and use of metamodels with Deep Learning (DL) methods that are useful for making multi-criteria decisions in the design and optimization of one-way slabs. The main motivation behind this research has been to examine the possibilities of improving slab design by including this methodology in future tools, which is capable of calculating thousands of solutions in real time based on the designer’s specifications. The process of creating these metamodels begins by developing a database of millions of combinations of slab designs. These combinations are calculated with a heuristic algorithm that provides the following results: rigidity, deflection, cost per square meter, CO2 emissions and embodied energy. Once a database including the entire universe of possible solutions has been created, a metamodel is developed that is capable of “condensing” the implicit knowledge contained in the database. This metamodel is included within a Decision Support System (DSS) that produces thousands of solutions for slabs that all comply with a range of specifications designated by the design plan. Furthermore, the methodology described herein proposes the use of Pareto-optimal solutions and graphic tools to help designers make multi-criteria decisions regarding the solutions that best fit their needs. A case study is presented to illustrate this proposal: optimizing slab design in two buildings according to technical, economic and sustainability criteria. The results indicate that the multi-criteria solutions obtained would entail a significant reduction in both emissions and embodied energy as compared to mono-criteria solutions, without significantly increasing costs."

To do so, the current study aimed to explore the relationship between RWQ and LMs by assessing 74 sub-basins within 2 million ha in Northern Iran. Principal component analyses were used to identify principal water quality parameters. Considering the effect of composition and configuration of the Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) on pollution loads, statistical models revealed that by increasing the mean of the Fractal Dimension Index of agricultural lands, the nitrate loads will increase. The results of this study can be especially used in the environmental impact/risk assessment of new industrial and residential applications. Also, the findings of the current study could provide a perfect source for calculations and choosing the best policy making decisions."

abstract = "Wind erosion in arid and semi-arid regions is a serious concern because it can cause land degradation and consequently affect the land use pattern. The aim of this study was to assess the variations of aeolian sediments and gypsum sediment surfaces (ASGSS) during 1992–2017 in Sejzy Plain and to analyze the impact of plans against desertification, as well as human and environmental activities on the variations of these surfaces. In the current study, Landsat satellite images were classified using the multiple layer perceptron (MLP) neural network. Finally, the logistic regression model has been used to study the impact and role of plans against desertification, human and environmental activities on the ASGSS variations in the studied area. The ASGSS decreased from 37.9% in 1992 to 24.3% in 2017 in the study area. Investigation of the effect of aeolian desertification in the region showed that planting stabilizing species and preventive measures taken in controlling gypsum-mining activities and grill areas, especially in the northern parts of the region has prevented further variation in the gypsum sediment cover. The results indicate that the planting of stabilizing species in lands outside the ASGSS has a greater effect on reducing ASGSS, in comparison with the planting of stabilizing species in the interior lands of the and ASGSS. Also, the results show that policies related to plans against desertification have been useful in reducing lands with ASGSS."

Along with the increasing environmental consideration of the building impacts, the environmental assessment of buildings has gained substantial importance in the construction industry. In this study, an artificial neural network model is built to predict cost premium of LEED certified green buildings based on LEED categories. To verify the viability of the model, multiple regression analysis is used as a benchmarking model. After validating the prediction power of the neural network model, a global sensitivity analysis is utilized to provide a better understanding of possible relationships between input and output variables of the prediction model. Sustainable Sites and Energy & Atmosphere LEED categories were found to have the highest sensitivity in cost premium prediction. In this study, our goal was to reveal the significant relationships between LEED categories and the cost premium, and offer a decision model that can guide owners to estimate cost premiums based on sought LEED credits."

In India, medium and small towns have so far developed outside the envisaged planning, resulting in a leapfrog and haphazard growth. This paper has attempted to simulate the spatial extent of urban expansion and boundary demarcation for the purpose of efficient urban planning and land resource management. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model and a set of landscape metrics were used to delineate the Urban Growth Boundary (UGB) and characterize the future patterns of growth in Siliguri Municipal Corporation (SMC, India). In particular, two urban boundaries – namely, Urban Hard Boundary (UHB) and Urban Soft Boundary (USB) – were simulated. The results suggest a USB with the area of 123 km2 to address the basic service delivery and a UHB with the area of 211.88 km2 to manage the ecological fragmentation."
