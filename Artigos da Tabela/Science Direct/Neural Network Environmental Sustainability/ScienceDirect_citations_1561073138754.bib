abstract = "The energy efficiency is important evaluation criterion for new investment in machinery and equipment in addition to the classical parameters accuracy, performance, cost and reliability. Even the users in the automotive industry demand new acquisitions of energy consumed by a machine tool during machining. Large interrelated parameters that influence the energy consumption of a machine tool make the development of an appropriate predictive model a very difficult task. In this paper, a real machining experiment is referred to investigate the capability of artificial neural network model for predicting the value of energy consumption. Results indicate that the model proposed in the research is capable of predicting the energy consumption. The present scenario demands such type of models so that the acceptability of prediction models can be raised and can be applied in sustainable process planning during the manufacturing phase of life cycle of a machine tool."

abstract = "The penetration of photovoltaic (PV) energy into modern electric power and energy systems has been gradually increased in recent years due to its benefits of being abundant, inexhaustible and clean. In order to reduce the negative impacts of PV energy on electric power and energy systems, advanced forecasting approach with high-accuracy is a pressing need. Aimed at this, a novel hybrid method for deterministic PV power forecasting based on wavelet transform (WT) and deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) is firstly proposed in this paper. WT is used to decompose the original signal into several frequency series. Each frequency has better outlines and behaviors. DCNN is employed to extract the nonlinear features and invariant structures exhibited in each frequency. Then, a probabilistic PV power forecasting model that combines the proposed deterministic method and spine quantile regression (QR) is originally developed to statistically evaluate the probabilistic information in PV power data. The proposed deterministic and probabilistic forecasting methods are applied to real PV data series collected from PV farms in Belgium. Numerical results presented in the case studies demonstrate that the proposed methods exhibit the ability of improving forecasting accuracies in terms of seasons and various prediction horizons, when compared to conventional forecasting models."

Accordingly, the present study aims to apply a hybrid intelligent approach named ADE–BPNN, the back-propagation neural network (BPNN) model supported by an adaptive differential evolution algorithm, to estimate energy consumption. Most often, energy consumption is influenced by socioeconomic factors. The proposed hybrid model incorporates gross domestic product, population, import, and export data as inputs. An improved differential evolution with adaptive mutation and crossover is utilized to find appropriate global initial connection weights and thresholds to enhance the forecasting performance of the BPNN. A comparative example and two extended examples are utilized to validate the applicability and accuracy of the proposed ADE–BPNN model. Errors of the test data sets indicate that the ADE–BPNN model can effectively predict energy consumption compared with the traditional back-propagation neural network model and other popular existing models. Moreover, mean impact value based analysis is conducted for electrical energy consumption in U.S. and total energy consumption forecasting in China to quantitatively explore the relative importance of each input variable for the improvement of effective energy consumption prediction."

abstract = "Environmental processes are highly complex and their understanding involves the analysis of various quantitative and qualitative parameters (physical, chemical, geographical etc), which are more or less correlated. Appropriate environmental knowledge can deal with this complexity in a tractable way. Such knowledge is essential for solving particular environmental problems. Generating valuable environmental knowledge is a challenging research topic, especially for environmental data science, as efficient knowledge can lie behind data. Integrated environmental modelling uses a holistic view and can provide a possible better solution to environmental problems understanding. The paper presents a knowledge modelling framework for intelligent environmental decision support systems (IEDSS) by following such a holistic perspective. Thus, the proposed framework integrates an ontological approach and two data analysis approaches (data mining and Bayesian networks), which are applied for the generation of a knowledge base that is used by an IEDSS for decision making. The application of the framework is illustrated on three case studies from different environmental domains: (1) water (river resource management, river water pollution analysis), (2) air (air pollution analysis, ozone prediction), and (3) soil (soil pollution analysis)."

To ameliorate effect on estuarine fisheries, regression models using fish catch and freshwater inflow have been implemented to determine minimum flow necessary to sustain these populations. These models typically use streamflow data, with no correction for evaporation and precipitation. Our models including evaporation and precipitation developed using artificial neural network (ANN) ensembles had nearly 50% better classification accuracy compared to regression model using flow. This ANN ensemble method was successfully applied to the Nueces Estuary in the United States. It can improve the decision-making processes of freshwater regulation and fishery management in many coastal regions."

abstract = "The prognosis of forest structure along the cutting cycle, using models of individual trees, is one of the alternatives to manage tropical forests aiming at sustainability. Currently, in forest management practiced in the Amazon Region, growth and production models are not used to predict the future stock of the forest. Thus, the sustainable economic and environmental aspects of this activity remain uncertain. The aim of this present work was to model the growth of individual trees in a forest managed in the Amazon Region, by using artificial neural networks (ANN) to serve as subsidy to the wielder in obtaining future stock after logging, thus reducing uncertainty on forest management sustainability. Selective harvest was carried out in 1979 with an intensity of 72.5 m3ha−1 in a 64ha area in the Tapajós National Forest - PA. In 1981, 36 permanent plots (50m×50m) were installed at random and inventoried. There were nine successive measurements in 1982, 1983, 1985, 1987, 1992, 1997, 2007, 2010, and 2012. In the modeling of the future diameter, training and testing of ANN were carried out, including different semi-independent competition indexes (DSICI). All ANN, with and without DSICI, presented correlation above 99%, RMSE below 11%, and EF above 0.98. Based on the prognosis of tree growth, we were able to conclude that ANN can be effectively used to assist in the management of tropical forests and, thus, allow for the most suitable cutting intensity and cutting cycle per species, ensuring environmental and economic sustainability of forest management."

Most of the regression models generally used sunshine hour data for the estimation of global solar radiations on the horizontal surfaces, whereas maximum artificial neural network models have used multilayer feed forward network sigmoid trained with Levenberg–Marquardt back propagation algorithm with different input terminals and different hidden layer neurons. Artificial neural networks have been successfully employed in solving complex problems in various fields such as function approximation, pattern association and pattern recognition, associative memories and generation of new meaningful pattern. Comparison of regression and artificial neural network models have shown that the performance values of the artificial neural network models are better than the regression models. The mean absolute percent error (MAPE) values of the artificial neural network models are lower than those of the regression models. In addition, the R values of the artificial neural network models are higher than those of regression models. The artificial neural network offers an alternative method which cannot be underestimated."

abstract = "Soil respiration is a biological process in microbes that convert organic carbon to atmospheric CO2. This process is considered to be one of the largest global carbon fluxes and is affected by different physicochemical and biological properties of soil, land use, vegetation types and climate patterns. Soil respiration recently received much attention, and it could be measured in two states basal respiration (BR) and substrate induced respiration (SIR) which together gives a good representation of the general soil microbial activity. The aim of this study was to estimate the BR and SIR of 150 data points obtained from soil samples collected from the surface to 20 cm of depth under different land use categories using the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Linear Regression Methodology (LRM). This study is bringing data from an arid area, and there is little information on this issue. Soil samples were chosen from three provinces of Iran, with humid subtropical and semi-arid climate patterns. In each soil sample a variety of characteristics were measured: soil texture, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), calcium carbonate equivalent (CCE), organic carbon (OC), OC fractionation data e.g. light fraction OC (LOC), heavy fraction OC (HOC), cold water extractable OC (COC) and warm water extractable OC (WOC), population of fungi, bacteria, actinomycete, BR and SIR. Our goal was to use the most efficient ANN-model to predict soil respiration with simple soil data and annual precipitation (AP) and mean annual temperature (MAT) and compare it with LRM. Our results indicated that for an ANN model containing all the measured soil parameters (14 variables), the R2 and RMSE values for BR prediction were 0.64 and 0.05 while these statistical indicators for SIR obtained 0.58 and 0.15, respectively; whereas the addition of AP and MAT data to this model (16 variables) caused a decrease in statistical indicators. When the R2 and RMSE values of the BR-ANN and SIR-ANN predicted using an ANN model with only 7 variables (including OC, pH, EC, CCE and soil texture) they were estimated to be 0.66, 0.043 and 0.52, 0.16, respectively. Overall, LRM in comparison to ANN had a lower R2. Therefore, the results show that ANN modeling is a reliable method for predicting soil respiration, even when based on easy to measure data. Our results revealed that highest and lowest BR and SIR were recorded in rice paddy soils and saline lands, respectively. In total, soil respiration (BR: 0.09 vs 0.06 and SIR: 0.46 vs 0.32 mg CO2 g−1 day−1) was higher in agricultural land compared to natural covered land."

The literature review has been performed using two academic databases and spans the years 1960–2014. The paper shows that despite the increasing number of papers on the subject, several areas of research are still being neglected. In particular, the paper highlights six main literature gaps concerning the classification of green initiatives, the impact of green initiatives on LSP performance, the evaluation of sustainability performance, the factors influencing the adoption of environmental sustainability initiatives, the customer perspective in the sustainable supply chain, and the information and communication technologies supporting green initiatives. Starting from these six gaps, eight research questions have been identified. These research questions represent possible emerging areas of investigation on the topic."

In Turkey, the agriculture sector is a major contributor to the national economy and consequently growth in agriculture leads to economic growth; which in turn affects pollution levels. In this paper, we present a novel application of neural networks based on using the simple and yet efficient back propagation learning algorithm. We estimate the carbon dioxide (CO2) emission levels by approximating the non-linear relationship between agricultural factors and alterations in CO2 emission levels. We use a public Turkish dataset spanning 1968-2010 and showing recorded major agricultural and economical indictors and the level of CO2. The experimental results indicate that such approximation is successfully possible and encouraging to be used in more similar non-linear applications."

However, the adoption of suitable indicators and reliable methods still requires attention to provide a basis for a more accurate understanding of eco-environmental effects from urbanization. The aggregated index system representing the coupling relationships between urbanization and eco-environment was introduced and an integrated sustainable development approach (ISD) to simulate and evaluate the integrative effects was developed in this paper. The ISD consists of modules of the coupling relationship assessments, systematic analysis of potential eco-environmental changes, and sustainability evaluation. An interpretative structural modeling (ISM) and grey relative technique (GRT) are used to analyze the systematical structure and assess the coupling relationships. A system dynamics model (SD) and artificial neural network (ANN) are used to simulate the potential environmental changes and compare the sustainability, respectively. An application study of Jiangsu province in China was performed, where the general eco-environmental integrity is under significant urbanization pressure. The potential eco-environmental scenarios from 2010 to 2015 under natural, populated, economic, spatial and social urbanization patterns were simulated and analyzed. The result reveals that the urbanization sustainability may be met on condition that either populated urbanization or social urbanization pattern is adopted in Jiangsu province, China. The aggregated indexes and ISD may help local authorities better understand and address the complex coupling relationship, and develop improved regional environmental management strategies that better balance urbanization and eco-environmental conservation."

Born as an alternative to GDP, the Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare (ISEW) is applied in this study as a framework to predict socio-economic and environmental performances of Luxembourg in relation to energy policy scenarios. The ISEW for the 1960–2010 timeframe is firstly calculated and compared with GDP in order to disclose the impact of factors differently considered by the two indices, e.g. consumption trends, equity, air pollution, carbon emissions, consumer durables expenditures, investments, etc. A forecasting model to predict the ISEW trend until 2030 is then proposed to assess the relevance of national energy policies. The analysis of historical time-series shows that the ISEW grows over time at much slower pace than GDP, mostly due to increases in defensive expenditures. This gap may decline in the future by implementing those energy policies, providing a slight but tangible recovery of the economic welfare over the next 10–15 years. Several insights are ultimately given on the benefits and drawbacks of using the ISEW framework to assess long-term sustainability issues."
