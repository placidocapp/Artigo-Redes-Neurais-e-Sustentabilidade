abstract = "The aim of this research was to predictive control of CO2 emissions by modelling the correlations between fuel nature structure (elementary composition) and CO2 emissions from a grate boiler. Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) coupled with Genetic Algorithms (GA), which facilitates the learning algorithms to figure out the local minimum deviation, is employed to map the highly nonlinear relationships between elements such as C, H and O in fuels and final CO2 emission. A total of 15,000 training and testing data come from the recordings of a grate boiler within six months. And the predicted CO2 emissions based on fuel nature structure matched the measured data with fairly good agreement. Finally, the Box-Behnken experimental design methodology was used to extract the mathematical expression between elements in fuels and CO2 emission. Consequently, by knowing the C, H and O composition in fuels, the CO2 emission can be well forecasted, in such way, it is sensible to optimize the future fuel nature structure in order to achieve clean carbon footprint and control the CO2 emissions."

abstract = "One of the most important policy reforms for the European Union (EU) agriculture was the implementation of the Agenda 2000, which establishes a new framework for subsidies management, decoupled from both crop and animal production for the vast majority of products. One of the main goals of this new policy framework is the improvement of its environmental impact. Additionally, there is a need for the implementation of new efficiency assessment and prognostication tools for the evaluation of EU farming, because the influence of market forces has been increased substantially. Having in mind the efficacy of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) methodology, it is used to calculate and quantify the environmental efficiency of EU countries' primary sectors. In this paper, the DEA Window methodology is used to assess GHG emissions efficiency and identify efficiency change of EU countries' primary sectors, under the strong influence of Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), quantifying by this way its positive or negative impact on a national basis, providing at the same time hints for counteractive actions. The main results provide the significant differences among EU countries, with the less developed ones to perform low environmental efficiency rates. Moreover, countries which their output depends to a large extend on arable crops achieve low efficiency rates too. Finally, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are being used as a tool to estimate future performance of EU countries primary sectors on the topic of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions as an undesirable output of agricultural production process. The validation performance characteristics, as well as the linear fit to this output-target relationship, closely intersect the bottom-left and top-right corners of the plot. The combination of these methodologies provides a new methodological approach for CAP evaluation and prognostication, appropriately adjusted to the new market oriented framework for EU agricultural production."

abstract = "Corrosion pits have been shown to nucleate fatigue cracks, and this is a critical issue for aerospace aluminum alloys, which experience a variety of corrosive environments in service. Consequently, modeling pit growth as a function of environment is necessary. In this study, two orientations of AA7075-T651 blocks were boldly exposed in solutions of varying temperature, pH, and [Cl−] for three exposure times. Optical profilometry and Weibull functions were utilized to characterize pit depth and diameter distributions. Artificial neural networks were a powerful tool in effectively modeling maximum pit dimensions and Weibull parameters. In most environments, pit growth followed t1/3 kinetics."

abstract = "Deterministic photochemical air quality models are commonly used for regulatory management and planning of urban airsheds. These models are complex, computer intensive, and hence are prohibitively expensive for routine air quality predictions. Stochastic methods are becoming increasingly popular as an alternative, which relegate decision making to artificial intelligence based on Neural Networks that are made of artificial neurons or ‘nodes’ capable of ‘learning through training’ via historic data. A Neural Network was used to predict particulate matter concentration at a regulatory monitoring site in Phoenix, Arizona; its development, efficacy as a predictive tool and performance vis-à-vis a commonly used regulatory photochemical model are described in this paper. It is concluded that Neural Networks are much easier, quicker and economical to implement without compromising the accuracy of predictions. Neural Networks can be used to develop rapid air quality warning systems based on a network of automated monitoring stations."

abstract = "This paper presents a methodology that combines the power of an Artificial Neural Network and Information Theory to forecast variables describing the condition of a regional system. The novelty and strength of this approach is in the application of Fisher information, a key method in Information Theory, to preserve trends in the historical data and prevent over fitting projections. The methodology was applied to demographic, environmental, food and energy consumption, and agricultural production in the San Luis Basin regional system in Colorado, U.S.A. These variables are important for tracking conditions in human and natural systems. However, available data are often so far out of date that they limit the ability to manage these systems. Results indicate that the approaches developed provide viable tools for forecasting outcomes with the aim of assisting management toward sustainable trends. This methodology is also applicable for modeling different scenarios in other dynamic systems."

ANN and AnEn are used individually and in combination to generate forecasts for three solar power plants located in Italy. The computational scalability of the proposed solution is tested using synthetic data simulating 4450 PV power stations. The National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Yellowstone supercomputer is employed to test the parallel implementation of the proposed solution, ranging from one node (32 cores) to 4450 nodes (141,140 cores). Results show that a combined AnEn + ANN solution yields best results, and that the proposed solution is well suited for massive scale computation."

The work herein has the goal of coalescing relevant, recent work supporting the economic and environmental aspects of sustainability for early stage product development by focusing on the interfaces between product design and supply chain operations. This discussion is intended to highlight past accomplishments and to be a call for action to the research community for the development of integrated methods, models, and tools to support sustainability initiatives across product supply chains. A literature review spanning product design, manufacturing, and supply operations management reveals several near-term research needs, which are organized into four highly promising foci addressing product architecture engineering, assembly/disassembly operation modeling, manufacturing process modeling, and joint optimization of life cycle activities. Finally, potential avenues for future collaborative research are presented and discussed."
