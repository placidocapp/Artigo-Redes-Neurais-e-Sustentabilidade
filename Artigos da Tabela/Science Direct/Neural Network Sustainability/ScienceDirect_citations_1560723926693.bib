abstract = "This study estimated energy use flow of buffalo farms, energy use indices, production efficiency, energy use targets, impact of energy inputs on energy output, and sensitivity analysis of energy inputs. A well-structured questionnaire was used to collect data of 360 domestic buffalo farms from Punjab Pakistan during May-July, 2017. Results revealed that milk production was mainly dependent on renewable energy inputs, particularly millet, minerals, concentrates, and sorghum. Energy use efficiency (0.08) and production efficiency (0.24) indicate that energy inputs were overused. An artificial neural network (ANN) method suggested that 30.5% of total energy input could be saved if farmers followed the targeted inputs recommended by ANN. The Cobb-Douglas production function found a negative significant impact of sorghum, millet, and wheat straw; and positive significant impact of labour, concentrates, and electricity on energy output. Among the non-renewable energy sources, electricity was found to be the most wasteful use of energy input, mainly due to the mismanagement of farmers. Sensitivity analysis estimated that a unit increase in renewable energy significantly decreased milk yield by 0.02 unit. While a unit increase in non-renewable energy significantly increased milk yield by 0.01 unit. This study stresses the importance of using energy inputs at the target quantities prognosticated by ANN method, and recommends the use of energy-efficient equipment."

Artificial neural networks (ANN) have been recently used to forward-calculate pavement layer moduli from falling weight deflectometer (FWD) test results. A full bond layer interface condition is commonly assumed to perform pavement layer moduli calculations; however, this condition is not guaranteed to happen in the field. The objective of this study was to develop ANN models capable of predicting pavement layer moduli rapidly and reliably for full bond and full slip layer interface conditions. ANN models were used to estimate the moduli of the National Center for Asphalt Technology (NCAT) Test Track structural sustainable sections for the full bond (FB) condition and the full slip (FS) condition. The results indicated that WMA sections had lower moduli at all tested temperatures compared to a control section (7–10% lower), likely due to the reduced binder aging experienced by these sections. RAP sections had higher moduli (16–43% higher) and were less susceptible to changes in temperature due to the presence of stiffer aged binder. Overall, backcalculated layer moduli using the conventional iterative approach had the highest error, followed by a significant decrease in error by ANN predicted moduli under full bond condition. However, the consideration of the ANN with full slip condition yielded the best results (lowest error)."

abstract = "This work addresses with sensitivity and uncertainty of the energy conversion of an oscillation-body wave energy converter with an artificial neural-network-based controller. The smart controller applies the model predictive control strategy to implement real-time latching control to the wave energy converter. Since the control inputs are future wave forces, an artificial neural network is developed and trained by the machine learning algorithm to predict the short-term wave forces based on the real-time measurement of wave elevation. The sensitivity of wave energy conversion with respect to wave frequency and receding horizon length are investigated. Uncertainties of the neural network that lead to the prediction deviation are identified and quantified, and their influences on the energy conversion are examined. The control command is derived inappropriately in the presence of prediction deviation leading to the reduction of energy absorption. Moreover, it is the phase deviation that reduces the energy absorption."

This model is based on the prediction of CO2 emissions until 2050 taking into account the current Energy Policy of the EU. The results show that artificial neural networks model this system very well and that this model has the ability to predict the behaviour of CO2 emissions. This will also enable timely response and correction of energy and economic strategy by changing the value of the relevant indicators in order to achieve the ambitious planned reductions of CO2 emissions by 2050. These plans are specified in the Energy Roadmap 2050 document of the European Commission from 2012 and promote economically cost-effective scenarios that will adapt the European Union's economy to the needs of environmental protection and the reduction of energy consumption. Several structures of Artificial Neural Networks were analysed in order to select the best one for modelling large energy systems. It was determined that the model with the Cascade Forward Back Propagation structure with numerous specific indicators can model such energy systems and predict of CO2 emissions with acceptable accuracy."

Especially in remote areas, where reliability issues associated with integrated systems result in problems of insufficient power supply or supply loss due to the intermittency of renewable sources and varying freshwater demand. This research aims to design a sustainable and reliable hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) coupled with RO desalination system (HRES-RO), considering different operational scenarios with fluctuating renewable energy supply, and changeable water demand. First, future energy supply from renewable sources, and water demand were forecasted to deal with the stochastic behavior of several variables including freshwater demand, ambient temperature, solar radiation, and wind speed by means of recurrent neural networks (RNN). Then, multi-criteria optimization was conducted using extended mathematical programming (EMP) with the aim of minimizing the total annual costs and greenhouse gas emission. Finally, the potential loss of power supply probability (PLPSP) was introduced as a tool to illustrate the sustainability of the proposed scenarios. The results showed that the proposed framework resulted in an HRES with optimized installation strategy using 111 photovoltaic panels and 5 wind turbines by considering three criteria (economic cost, environmental effect, and energy reliability). The designed system reduced PLPSP by 18.3% compared with the base case. Furthermore, the results demonstrated the contribution of advanced forecasting algorithms to address future uncertainties in the energy supply chain."

The model is based on neural networks. Temperature scenarios obtained from historical data are used as inputs to the neural networks in order to create load scenarios, and these load scenarios are then transformed into quantiles. By using a feature selection approach that is based on a stepwise regression technique, a neural network based model is developed for each zone. Furthermore, a dynamic choice of the temperature scenarios is suggested. The feature selection and dynamic choice of the temperature scenarios can improve the quantile scores considerably, resulting in very accurate forecasts among the top teams."

Studies conducted thus far have covered mainly linear models. Most of case studies focused on single countries or groups of countries with only few focusing on the sub-national scale. This paper is pioneering in covering an area of Poland (Central Europe) at NUTS-2 level. The use of ANN enabled the modeling of the non-linear relations associated with the complex structure of electricity demand. Satellite data were collected for the period 2013–2016, and included images with improved quality (inter alia higher resolution), compared to the DMSP/OLS program. As images are available from April 2012 onwards, it is only recently that their number has become sufficient for ANN learning. The images were used to create models of multilayer perceptrons. The results achieved by ANN were compared with the results obtained using linear regressions. Studies have confirmed that electricity consumption can be determined with higher precision by the ANN method."

abstract = "Increasing urbanization has been one of the most significant concerns of urban managers. The role of non-motorized transportation in sustainable urban development is vitally important for reducing overweight and obesity among citizens. These issues have led to numerous studies of the association between environmental characteristics, walkability index and levels of human health. The encouragement of public walking and cycling requires measures of walkability indices. One of the common challenges in measuring a walkability index is the complexity of the connection between the subjective indices resulting from public opinion and objective measures of geographic data. The scientific novelty of this paper lies in two aspects: First we developed and evaluated several artificial neural network (ANN) configurations for predicting subjective measures of walkability index from objective measures. Second, we introduced an index for two distinctive modes of walkability: daily shopping and recreation purposes that ranges from 1 to 10. The parameters of land-use diversity, population density, intersection density, network density, access to public transportation, green spaces and commercial places were utilized to calculate the objective value of the walkability index. The determination of subjective value of the walkability index was achieved using fieldwork reports. The resulting index was tested in districts 1 and 3 of Region 18 in the city of Tehran. The quantities used to evaluate the results included RMSE, MAE, MBE, and R. Network training was performed using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. A 10-fold cross validation was used to evaluate and compare the performance of different network configurations. Our findings indicated that the best walkability index for purchasing can be estimated using Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm with one hidden layer and seven neurons. This configuration resulted in a correlation coefficient and an RMSE of 93.79% and 0.1368 respectively. To predict the walkability index for recreational purpose, the best result was obtained using Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, representing a combination of one layer with four neurons for which the correlation coefficient and RMSE are 90.71% and 0.1602 respectively."
