abstract = "The need to promote a sustainable land management (SLM) approach for land degradation neutrality (LDN) is a global challenge, and we must rely on local assessments of how rural participants are conducting their work. Therefore, the objectives of the present research are as follows: 1) evaluate the fruit culture of the guava producers (Psidium guajava, L.) in Calvillo, Aguascalientes, Mexico; and 2) to show whether it is possible to detect key variables in SLM by using an artificial neural network to improve productivity. The study unit (SU) was located in the community of San Tadeo (21.917 °N and 102.701 °W) in the municipality of Calvillo, Aguascalientes. We considered a total of 430 ha established with this fruit and nine orchards that consisted of 9.05 ha, which is equivalent to 2.09% of the total area. Each hectare was randomly sampled, with a significance of 95% (α ≥ 0.05). The information was collected by using empirical field techniques and a questionnaire sent to the producers. The results revealed that the productive success of the SU is based on the knowledge and ability of the fruit farmers to take advantage of bioclimatic and biophysical conditions for guava cultivation. It was demonstrated in approximately 90% of the analyzed cases that the producer’s SLM was between regular and excellent. This result was confirmed by the index of edaphic adequacy (Iea), which was created by nine of thirteen variables measured in the field, that indicated in 47% of the orchards (OR), the edaphic condition is optimum (Iea = 0) or close to optimum (-0.2 ≥ Iea ≤ 0.2). In addition, by using a Multilayer Percetron (MLP), it was possible to detect two key aspects in the producers’ work: cava design (DC) and soil management (SM)."

abstract = "Before a photovoltaic (PV) system is installed, a prerequisite modelling and performance analysis are carried out which estimates the performance parameters and reliability in operation of PV system. This paper proposes a neural network approach to performance prediction of PV Modules. Here the feed forward neural networks are used to predict I-V curve parameters as a function on input irradiance and temperature. K Fold cross-validation is used to validate model accuracy for determination of I-V curve parameters for five different technology modules, i.e., CdTe, CIGS, MICROMORPH, MUTICRYSTALLINE, MAXEON. A comparison is also drawn between the neural network predictor and the existing modeling procedures available. Model parameters have been determined following iterative, analytical and regression of known data points for seven and five parameter model of PV Modules. Among the electrical equivalent models, the seven parameter model is the most efficient model for performance prediction however commutation of model parameters in complex and tedious. Neural network model simplifies the computational process at the expense of higher error variance in comparison to electrical equivalent models. Further, a cascade implementation of the above two is designed and tested on Multicrystalline and Maxeon technology modules for higher model accuracy. The results obtained, verify the proposed cascaded model to be the most efficient model in comparison to independent models where mean bias error deviations are less than ±1% and error variance is reduced significantly. Also, a MATLAB based graphical user interface (GUI) is developed that can be used to predict the performance based on the analysis carried out. The proposed model is tested against a set of operating conditions and compared to the actual experimental values obtained using outdoor tests."

abstract = "This paper presents the application of Artificial Neural Networks for the simulation of the performance parameters of a hybrid thermoelectric generator, using the artificial neural networks tool in the MATLAB software under various temperature, load and series condition. The simulated parameters (till an input heater temperature of about 250 °C) are compared with experimental results and the average error between the experimental approach and ANN based approach for all the parameter values is less than 3%. This low error value shows that the experiments need not be repeated for input temperatures above 250 °C which is quite complex. Hence, the effect of temperature gradient on the hybrid thermoelectric generator performance upto 350 °C of the hot side temperature with a single module and “N” no. of series connection have been estimated using ANN methodology. Experimental results suggest the necessity for ANN based approaches for hybrid TEG applications."

abstract = "This study applies an artificial neural network (ANN) to develop models for forecasting carbon emission intensity for Australia, Brazil, China, India, and USA. Nine parameters that play an essential role in contributing to carbon emissions intensity were selected as input variables. The input parameters are economic growth, energy consumption, R&D, financial development, foreign direct investment, trade openness, industrialisation, and urbanisation. The study used quarterly data which span over the period 1980Q1-2015Q4 to develop, train and validate the models. To ensure the reproducibility of the results, twenty simulations were performed for each country. After numerous iterations, the optimal models for each country were selected based on predefined criteria. A 9-5-1 multi-layer perceptron with back-propagation algorithm was sufficient in building the models which have been trained and validated. Results from the validated models show that the predicted versus actual values indicate approximately zero errors along with higher coefficients of determination (R2) of 0.80 for Australia, 0.91 for Brazil, 0.95 for China, 0.99 for India and 0.87 for USA. The Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient (PRCC) results reveal that for Australia, R&D has the highest sensitivity weight while for Brazil and the USA, urbanisation has the highest sensitivity weight. For China, population size has the highest sensitivity weight while energy consumption has the highest sensitivity weight in India. The ANN models presented in this study have been validated and reliable to predict the growth of CO2 emission intensity for Australia, Brazil, China, India, and USA with negligible forecasting errors. The models developed from this study could serve as tools for international organisations and environmental policymakers to forecast and help in climate change policy decision-making."
