abstract = "Sensitivity analysis establishes priorities for research and allows to identify and rank the most important factors which lead to great improvements in output factors. The aim of this study is to examine sensitivity analysis of inputs in grape production. We are proposing to perform sensitivity analysis using partial rank correlation coefficient (PRCC) which is the most reliable and efficient method, and we apply this for the first time in crop production. This research investigates the use of energy in the vineyard of a semi-arid zone of Iran. Energy use efficiency, energy productivity, specific energy and net energy were calculated. Various artificial neural network (ANN) models were developed to predict grape yield with respect to input energies. ANN models consist of a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with seven neurons in the input layer, one and two hidden layer(s) with different number of neurons, and an output layer with one neuron. Input energies were labor, machinery, chemicals, farmyard manure (FYM), diesel, electricity and water for irrigation. Sensitivity analysis was performed on over 100 samples of parameter space generated by Latin hypercube sampling method, which was then fed to the ANN model to predict the yield for each sample. The PRCC between the predicted yield and each parameter value (input) was used to calculate the sensitivity of the model to each input. Results of sensitivity analysis showed that machinery had the greatest impact on grape yield followed by diesel fuel and labor."

abstract = "Dramatically increased societal demands on the municipal services that contradict environmental protection and information processing capability oriented to resource utilization efficiency suffer from opposing simultaneous requirements. The smart city provides better solutions for urban areas which are increasing at an unprecedented speed. This paper presents an empirical study carried out to assess and analyze the development pattern of 35 smart cities in China using the principal component analysis (PCA) and back propagation (BP) neural network techniques. The proposed PCA-BP neural network assessment processing model is applied with six dimensional factors and twenty-two operating indices. With the feature extraction and performance score calculated via PCA, BP neural network is adopted for city classification to recognize the development differences in smart cities. The results indicate that the factor-driven impetus evolves into innovation-driven impetus, narrowing the gap from the holistic perspective between the first and middle-ranking groups, while two middle-ranking groups show a similar upward trend in terms of developing a smart economy through sustainable productivity in innovative enterprises and high-tech industry. To some extent, in response to a similar improving trend in the application of smart services, a distinct advantage of an individual index can be a complementary offset to unapparent holistic highlighting the reception of the lowest average points. Unbalanced development exists in two subaverage groups that are deficient in the initial inventory of smart infrastructure and demands. A relatively large difference exists in the smart mobility index among cities, whereas the opposite case is found concerning the smart environment index. Finally, corresponding optimized development pattern are recommended for building a sustainable smart city."

abstract = "Cloud-assisted internet of things (CIoT) is backboned by the wireless sensor network (WSN) architecture. A sensor network is an autonomous self-resource constraint collection of internet of things (IoT) sensor nodes. The nodes communicate in an ad-hoc fashion to transfer cloud information over the virtual environment. Clustering in WSNs helps to improve the quality of the network by controlling energy consumption and improving data gathering accuracy. This improves the service rates of CIoT. Optimizing IoT sensor networks through energy and overhead management requires complex clustering algorithms. A simple clustering scheme cannot achieve the desired performance enhancement during transmission in a virtual environment. This research attempts to propose a reinforcement-based learning technique, adaptive Q-learning (AQL) to improve network performance with minimum energy–overhead tradeoff in a sensor network-aided CIoT. AQL operates in two distinct phases for cluster head selection and forwarder selection. The decision-making system is used to qualify nodes based on their past behavior over transmission. AQL improves both inter- and intra-cluster communication optimization through adaptive forwarder and header selection conditions. The simulation results prove the consistency of the proposed AQL by retaining the live node counts in the network and their persistent energy despite the reduced overheads in the sensor network. With the achievement of constructive features in the sensor networks, the performance of CIoT is considerably improved. The experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed learning technique by improving network lifetime with a high request–response rate and by minimizing delay, overhead, and request failures."

abstract = "We demonstrate the use of a surrogate-based optimization framework for large-scale and high-resolution landscape management optimization, using irrigated corn production systems in eastern Colorado, USA as a case study. An artificial neural network was employed to create a surrogate of the DayCent biogeochemical simulation model. Our optimization considered trade-offs among seven different objectives at different scales, including farm profits, irrigation water use, corn grain, corn stover, soil organic carbon (SOC), greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and nitrogen leaching. The results show that the surrogate captured greater than 99% of the variations in the DayCent’s simulated outputs and was 6.2 million times faster than the DayCent model for our analysis. Farm-level optimization increased farm profits by 83%–150%, SOC by 16%–53%, grain yield by 10.1–11.3%, and reduced GHG emissions by 19%–55% compared to the ‘business-as-usual’ scenario."
