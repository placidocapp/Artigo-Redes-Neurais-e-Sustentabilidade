abstract = "Smart growth, as a service to the economy, environment and society, has increasingly become the development pattern for cities of the world, but the degree of smart growth varies from city to city, and not all smart growth plans are suitable for current cities or countries. Therefore, it is of practical significance to measure the success degree of smart growth plan. The current model is accompanied by some problems such as subjectivity, unable to prioritize each plan, and so on. In this paper, an evaluating model was established to scientifically measure and adjust the smart growth plan based on BP neural network and set pair analysis. In this model, an evaluating metric(I) was defined, which was obtained by multiplying the ability score(A) and the coordinative development index(C). Applied to city's current plan, the model can tell us how successful the current plan is for this city, thus on the basis of evaluating result, better new plans for the city in the future can be developed. Finally, the effects of the new plans for population, economy-environment- society were discussed based on Lokta-Volterra equations and the environmental Kuznets curve. A case study was presented in two cities, Karamay and Atlanta. The result showed that the current plan in Atlanta is more successful than that in Karamay, but both the two plans are moderately successful. According to the results, a series of new plans were proposed and their priorities were ranked, the result showed that Atlanta should give priority to urban greening while Karamay give priority to economic development, and the effect of the scientific intelligence growth plan is to expand city's environmental capacity, promote the fair competition between the foreign population and the local population, and improve the balanced node, making the environment damage smaller, society and economic grow better. The model provides powerful reference for cities in developed and developing countries to formulate smart growth plans, especially for developing countries."

abstract = "Smart city is the term described to integrate all facilities to the people in a frequently accessible manner. Street lighting system is one of the part of the facility provided in smart cities. The unwanted utilisation of the street lighting affects the economic status of the country indirectly. Power consumption through street lighting is major problem, hence action plan is taken to promote the reduction policies of the power consumption. Reducing the unnecessary power consumption is not a simple task, but with soft computing approaches power consumption can be reduced. The objective of this article is to present an ANN based energy efficient smart street lighting systems. The proposed design were implemented and executed in a residential area, Hosur and the results are carried out at different scenarios and various seasons. The decision making module exploits the analysis factors obtained via lighting sensor, motion sensor, PIR sensor, etc. artificial neural network and fuzzy logic controller makes an efficient decision making process for demand based utilisation and to avoid the unnecessary utilisation of street lights. The five levels of scenarios are tested and implemented in a real time. Through this work, the smart and energy efficiency street lighting system reduced the unwanted utilisation by 34% and reduced the power consumption rate of 13.5%."

An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) has been used to develop a thermodynamic model to be used for the maximization of the production of power while keeping the size of the heat exchangers and hence the cost of the plant at its minimum. R1234yf has been selected as the working fluid. The results show that the use of ANN is promising in solving complex nonlinear optimization problems that arise in the field of thermodynamics."

abstract = "In order to achieve near-optimal fuel economy for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) using the equivalent consumption minimum strategy (ECMS), it is necessary to dynamically tune the equivalent factor (EF). Unlike widely used model-based approaches, this paper proposes a data-driven ECMS that determines the EF using an artificial neural network (ANN). First, by comparing Pontryagin's Minimum Principle (PMP) with the ECMS, one can find that the EF is related to the co-state value of the PMP method. Then, an ANN is constructed with three accessible input variables, including the current demanded power, the ratio of the distance travelled to the total distance, and the battery State of Charge (SOC). The neural network is subsequently trained using real-world speed profiles. Simulations are performed considering different initial SOC values. The results reveal that the proposed data-driven ECMS demonstrates satisfactory fuel economy compared to global optimization methods like dynamic programming and PMP methods. The computational time of the proposed method relative to the duration of the entire trip indicates a great potential for the development of a time-conscious energy management strategy. Moreover, the impact of training sample size on the ANN performance is discussed."

There is a grand variety of systems and services related to buildings, in order to better control and monitoring. The prompt taking of decisions may prevent costs and contamination. This paper proposes a method for energy consumption forecasting in public buildings, and thus, achieve energy savings, in order to improve the energy efficiency, without affecting the comfort and wellness. The prediction of the energy consumption is indispensable for the intelligent systems operations and planning. We propose an Elman neural network for forecasting such consumption and we use a genetic algorithm to optimize the weight of the models. This paper concludes that the proposed method optimizes the energy consumption forecasting and improves results attained in previous studies."

abstract = "Financial exploitation of forests comprises an important part of man activity. There are efforts being made to conserve the sustainable exploitation while simultaneously avoiding degradation of the environment. One tool used in these efforts is the modeling of tree features, such as total tree height, sawn-timber tree height, merchantable tree height, and total or sawn-timber tree volume, which yields an estimate of the forest in finance recoverable goods. Sustainable forest management design must be supported by the adjustment of computational techniques. The purpose of this paper is to assess a reliable modeling approach for estimating individual tree heights for the maturity of trees for logging through determining the applicability of different types of neural network models and identifying a neural network procedure for accurate estimation of these variables. These models serve as an alternative to the traditional regression approach. All types of model estimations are evaluated and compared in this paper. Back Propagation Artificial Neural Network (BPANN), Cascade Correlation Artificial Neural Network (CCANN), and Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN) models are developed to estimate individual tree heights for the logging of mature trees, such as sawn-timber height and merchantable height. The results reported in this research suggest that the selected BPANN and CCANN models are reliable and demonstrate their adequacy and potential for estimating sawn-timber and merchantable tree height. The results also illustrate that the CCANN models are superior to the BPANN and GRNN models and lead to higher estimation accuracy. Moreover, the NN models were found to be superior to the tested nonlinear regression models."
