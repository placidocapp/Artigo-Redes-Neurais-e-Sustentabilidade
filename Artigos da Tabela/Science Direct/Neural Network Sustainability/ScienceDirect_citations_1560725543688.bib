abstract = "Renewable energy from wind and solar resources can contribute significantly to the decarbonisation of the conventionally fossil-driven electricity grid. However, their seamless integration with the grid poses significant challenges due to their intermittent generation patterns, which is intensified by the existing uncertainties and fluctuations from the demand side. A resolution is increasing energy storage and standby power generation which results in economic losses. Alternatively, enhancing the predictability of wind and solar energy as well as demand enables replacing such expensive hardware with advanced control and optimization systems. The present research contribution establishes consistent sets of data and develops data-driven models through machine-learning techniques. The aim is to quantify the uncertainties in the electricity grid and examine the predictability of their behaviour. The predictive methods that were selected included conventional artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector regression (SVR) and Gaussian process regression (GPR). For each method, a sensitivity analysis was conducted with the aim of tuning its parameters as optimally as possible. The next step was to train and validate each method with various datasets (wind, solar, demand). Finally, a predictability analysis was performed in order to ascertain how the models would respond when the prediction time horizon increases. All models were found capable of predicting wind and solar power, but only the neural networks were successful for the electricity demand. Considering the dynamics of the electricity grid, it was observed that the prediction process for renewable wind and solar power generation, and electricity demand was fast and accurate enough to effectively replace the alternative electricity storage and standby capacity."

abstract = "Valid and dependable water demand prediction is a major element of the effective and sustainable expansion of municipal water infrastructures. This study provides a novel approach to quantifying water demand through the assessment of climatic factors, using a combination of a pretreatment signal technique, a hybrid particle swarm optimisation algorithm and an artificial neural network (PSO-ANN). The Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) technique was adopted to decompose and reconstruct water consumption in relation to six weather variables, to create a seasonal and stochastic time series. The results revealed that SSA is a powerful technique, capable of decomposing the original time series into many independent components including trend, oscillatory behaviours and noise. In addition, the PSO-ANN algorithm was shown to be a reliable prediction model, outperforming the hybrid Backtracking Search Algorithm BSA-ANN in terms of fitness function (RMSE). The findings of this study also support the view that water demand is driven by climatological variables."

abstract = "In this paper, we explore the strategic significance of three factors – operational efficiency, measured by data envelope analysis; environmental sustainability, represented by Newsweek's Green Rankings; and corporate reputation, based on Fortune's list of most admired companies in the world –and their relationship to the market valuation of high-tech-oriented companies. In particular, we estimate the impact of these factors on Tobin's Q, which represents the overall technological and market strength of a firm as a forward-looking market performance reflecting stakeholders' expectations of the value of a firm. Using complementary regression and a neural network approach, we find that operational efficiency has the largest impact on Tobin's Q, followed by corporate reputation and environmental sustainability. In addition to its findings on the relative importance of these strategic factors, the paper's findings also suggest that operational efficiency, which reflects efficiency-driven best practice and managerial proficiency, is a crucial determinant of the market-facing measure of Tobin's Q in high-tech industries. Using models to estimate the interaction between these variables, we find that environmental sustainability and its interaction with reputation has the largest synergistic effect on Tobin's Q, followed by the interaction of reputation and operational efficiency. Our results show that the interaction of unique performance metrics can provide insights that differ from those derived from models for which the interaction is not included. Furthermore, the discovery of varying impact patterns under distinguishable capabilities is another significant finding of the paper."

abstract = "An accurate and effective air quality index (AQI) forecasting is one of the necessary conditions for the promotion of urban public health, and to help society to be sustainable notwithstanding the effects of air pollution. This study proposes a hybrid AQI forecasting model to enhance forecasting accuracy. Variational mode decomposition (VMD) was applied to decompose the original AQI series into different sub-series with various frequencies. Then, sample entropy (SE) was applied to recombine the sub-series to solve the issues of over-decomposition and computational burden. Next, a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network was established, to forecast those new sub-series, following which the ultimate AQI forecast could be obtained, by accumulating prediction values from each sub-series. The results illustrated that: (1) the proposed VMD-SE-LSTM model displayed superior capacity for daily urban AQI forecasting, as shown using test case data from Beijing and Baoding; (2) when the proposed model was compared with other models, the results indicated that VMD-SE-LSTM model comprehensively captured the characteristics of the original AQI series. Besides, the proposed model had a high rate of correct AQI class forecasting, which existing single models cannot achieve, while other hybrid models can only reflect AQI series trends with limited prediction accuracy."

The study presents a solution to this problem by neural networks. Application of neural networks allows to overcome the lack of available information on the input and to carry out the correct assessment of the environmental safety of territorial entities. Method of training a neural network is used for this. The advantages of using fuzzy neural networks are the flexibility and the opportunity to work directly with implicit parameters and criteria known to approximate or unknown data; a tolerance of ambiguities and contradictions of used data. This technique allowed solve the following tasks: to carry out a typology of subjects of the Russia in terms of environmental safety and to develop scenarios increase their security; to perform a forecast of changes in their development, taking into account environmental factors."

abstract = "The electricity consumption forecasting is a challenging task, because the predictive accuracy is easily affected by multiple external factors, such as society, economics, environment, as well as the renewable energy, including hydro power, wind power and solar power. Particularly, in the smart grid with large amount of data, how to extract valuable information of those external factors timely is the key to the success of electricity consumption forecasting. A method of probability density forecasting based on Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator-Quantile Regression Neural Network (LASSO-QRNN) is proposed in this paper. First, important features are extracted from external factors affecting the electricity consumption forecasting by LASSO regression. Then, the LASSO-QRNN model is constructed to predict annual electricity consumption. The results of electricity consumption forecasting under different quantiles in the next several years are evaluated. Besides, we introduce kernel density estimation into our LASSO-QRNN model, which can give a probability distribution instead of a single-valued prediction. The prediction accuracy is evaluated through the empirical analyses from the Guangdong province dataset in China and the California dataset in the United States. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method provides better performance for electricity consumption forecasting, in comparison with existing quantile regression neural network (QRNN), back-propagation of errors neural network (BP), radial basis function neural network (RBF), quantile regression (QR) and nonlinear quantile regression (NLQR). LASSO-QRNN can not only better learn the high-dimensional data in electricity consumption forecasting, but also provide more precise results."

In order to improve prediction accuracy, ensemble of neural networks is examined. Three different combinations of output are analyzed. It is shown that all proposed neural networks can predict heating consumption with great accuracy, and that using ensemble achieves even better results."
