abstract = "Sensitivity analysis establishes priorities for research and allows to identify and rank the most important factors which lead to great improvements in output factors. The aim of this study is to examine sensitivity analysis of inputs in grape production. We are proposing to perform sensitivity analysis using partial rank correlation coefficient (PRCC) which is the most reliable and efficient method, and we apply this for the first time in crop production. This research investigates the use of energy in the vineyard of a semi-arid zone of Iran. Energy use efficiency, energy productivity, specific energy and net energy were calculated. Various artificial neural network (ANN) models were developed to predict grape yield with respect to input energies. ANN models consist of a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with seven neurons in the input layer, one and two hidden layer(s) with different number of neurons, and an output layer with one neuron. Input energies were labor, machinery, chemicals, farmyard manure (FYM), diesel, electricity and water for irrigation. Sensitivity analysis was performed on over 100 samples of parameter space generated by Latin hypercube sampling method, which was then fed to the ANN model to predict the yield for each sample. The PRCC between the predicted yield and each parameter value (input) was used to calculate the sensitivity of the model to each input. Results of sensitivity analysis showed that machinery had the greatest impact on grape yield followed by diesel fuel and labor."

abstract = "Smart growth, as a service to the economy, environment and society, has increasingly become the development pattern for cities of the world, but the degree of smart growth varies from city to city, and not all smart growth plans are suitable for current cities or countries. Therefore, it is of practical significance to measure the success degree of smart growth plan. The current model is accompanied by some problems such as subjectivity, unable to prioritize each plan, and so on. In this paper, an evaluating model was established to scientifically measure and adjust the smart growth plan based on BP neural network and set pair analysis. In this model, an evaluating metric(I) was defined, which was obtained by multiplying the ability score(A) and the coordinative development index(C). Applied to city's current plan, the model can tell us how successful the current plan is for this city, thus on the basis of evaluating result, better new plans for the city in the future can be developed. Finally, the effects of the new plans for population, economy-environment- society were discussed based on Lokta-Volterra equations and the environmental Kuznets curve. A case study was presented in two cities, Karamay and Atlanta. The result showed that the current plan in Atlanta is more successful than that in Karamay, but both the two plans are moderately successful. According to the results, a series of new plans were proposed and their priorities were ranked, the result showed that Atlanta should give priority to urban greening while Karamay give priority to economic development, and the effect of the scientific intelligence growth plan is to expand city's environmental capacity, promote the fair competition between the foreign population and the local population, and improve the balanced node, making the environment damage smaller, society and economic grow better. The model provides powerful reference for cities in developed and developing countries to formulate smart growth plans, especially for developing countries."

abstract = "The need to promote a sustainable land management (SLM) approach for land degradation neutrality (LDN) is a global challenge, and we must rely on local assessments of how rural participants are conducting their work. Therefore, the objectives of the present research are as follows: 1) evaluate the fruit culture of the guava producers (Psidium guajava, L.) in Calvillo, Aguascalientes, Mexico; and 2) to show whether it is possible to detect key variables in SLM by using an artificial neural network to improve productivity. The study unit (SU) was located in the community of San Tadeo (21.917 °N and 102.701 °W) in the municipality of Calvillo, Aguascalientes. We considered a total of 430 ha established with this fruit and nine orchards that consisted of 9.05 ha, which is equivalent to 2.09% of the total area. Each hectare was randomly sampled, with a significance of 95% (α ≥ 0.05). The information was collected by using empirical field techniques and a questionnaire sent to the producers. The results revealed that the productive success of the SU is based on the knowledge and ability of the fruit farmers to take advantage of bioclimatic and biophysical conditions for guava cultivation. It was demonstrated in approximately 90% of the analyzed cases that the producer’s SLM was between regular and excellent. This result was confirmed by the index of edaphic adequacy (Iea), which was created by nine of thirteen variables measured in the field, that indicated in 47% of the orchards (OR), the edaphic condition is optimum (Iea = 0) or close to optimum (-0.2 ≥ Iea ≤ 0.2). In addition, by using a Multilayer Percetron (MLP), it was possible to detect two key aspects in the producers’ work: cava design (DC) and soil management (SM)."

abstract = "Dramatically increased societal demands on the municipal services that contradict environmental protection and information processing capability oriented to resource utilization efficiency suffer from opposing simultaneous requirements. The smart city provides better solutions for urban areas which are increasing at an unprecedented speed. This paper presents an empirical study carried out to assess and analyze the development pattern of 35 smart cities in China using the principal component analysis (PCA) and back propagation (BP) neural network techniques. The proposed PCA-BP neural network assessment processing model is applied with six dimensional factors and twenty-two operating indices. With the feature extraction and performance score calculated via PCA, BP neural network is adopted for city classification to recognize the development differences in smart cities. The results indicate that the factor-driven impetus evolves into innovation-driven impetus, narrowing the gap from the holistic perspective between the first and middle-ranking groups, while two middle-ranking groups show a similar upward trend in terms of developing a smart economy through sustainable productivity in innovative enterprises and high-tech industry. To some extent, in response to a similar improving trend in the application of smart services, a distinct advantage of an individual index can be a complementary offset to unapparent holistic highlighting the reception of the lowest average points. Unbalanced development exists in two subaverage groups that are deficient in the initial inventory of smart infrastructure and demands. A relatively large difference exists in the smart mobility index among cities, whereas the opposite case is found concerning the smart environment index. Finally, corresponding optimized development pattern are recommended for building a sustainable smart city."

An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) has been used to develop a thermodynamic model to be used for the maximization of the production of power while keeping the size of the heat exchangers and hence the cost of the plant at its minimum. R1234yf has been selected as the working fluid. The results show that the use of ANN is promising in solving complex nonlinear optimization problems that arise in the field of thermodynamics."

An artificial neural network was employed to create a surrogate of the DayCent biogeochemical simulation model. Our optimization considered trade-offs among seven different objectives at different scales, including farm profits, irrigation water use, corn grain, corn stover, soil organic carbon (SOC), greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and nitrogen leaching. The results show that the surrogate captured greater than 99% of the variations in the DayCent’s simulated outputs and was 6.2 million times faster than the DayCent model for our analysis. Farm-level optimization increased farm profits by 83%–150%, SOC by 16%–53%, grain yield by 10.1–11.3%, and reduced GHG emissions by 19%–55% compared to the ‘business-as-usual’ scenario."
