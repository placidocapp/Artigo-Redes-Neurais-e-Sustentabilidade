abstract="A sustainability program is about implementing essential sustainability practices at various intensities that will not harm people because of firm actions. This paper formulates an optimization model to identify an optimal intensity of implementation of selected sustainability practices referred as sustainability program for maximising manufacturing industry sustainability performance for a known set of budgetary and minimum thresholds constraints with respect to economic, social and socio-economic criteria. Besides modelling the paper proposes a random search procedure embedding the NN to determine the optimal sustainability program and explains the usefulness with a sample problem. Sensitivity analysis is carried out to understand the behaviour of the model. It is observed that the sustainability performances depend on the constraints such as budget limitation and threshold values of performance criterion.",
