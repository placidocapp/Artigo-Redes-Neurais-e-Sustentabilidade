abstract="In the present study, the conjunctive use policies of surface and ground water resources are developed for minimizing water shortage in an irrigation district subject to constraints on groundwater withdrawals and crop planning capacities. An integrated soil water balance algorithm is coupled to a non-linear optimization model in order to carry out water allocation planning in complex deficit agricultural water resources systems based on an economic efficiency criterion. Various options of conjunctive use water resources along with current and proposed cropping patterns have been explored by Koohdasht Irrigation District (KID), a semi-arid region in I.R. Iran. The analysis provides various scenarios, which can help managers in decision-making for the optimum allocation plans of water resources within the irrigation area. The results reveal that the proposed model, as a decision tool for optimal irrigated crop planning and water resources sustainability, may be used for maximizing the overall net benefits and global water productivity of an irrigation district considering an allowable annual recharge of groundwater. Findings indicate the importance of the conjunctive water management modeling, which can be easily implemented and would enhance the overall benefits from cropping activities in the study area.",
