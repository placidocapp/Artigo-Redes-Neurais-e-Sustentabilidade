abstract="The realization of ecological logistics evaluation model based on BCPSGA-BP neural network is beneficial to improve the level of logistics management in China, to achieve the purpose of energy saving and emission reduction, environmental protection and sustainable development. This paper discusses the construction of ecological logistics model through green logistics, agile logistics, lean logistics, reverse logistics, environmental protection logistics, recycling logistics, cleaner production and other logistics forms under the background of electronic commerce, Finally, CPSGA-BP neural network is proposed as an evaluation model to achieve the objective and accurate assessment of the ecological logistics performance model, and provides strong evidence and support for the development of ecological logistics.",
