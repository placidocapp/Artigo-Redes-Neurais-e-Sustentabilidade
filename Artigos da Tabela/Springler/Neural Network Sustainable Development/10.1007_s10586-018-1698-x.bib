abstract="This paper introduced detailed the design of intelligent system for decision-making. Firstly, the overall design of grassland degradation decision-making system of Sanjiangyuan based on neural network is carried out, including man--machine interface module, knowledge base module, neural network module and inference engine module. Secondly, the specific functions of each module are introduced. Finally, the design of neural network was introduced detailed, the entire BP neural network consists of three layers of structure. There are five nodes in the input layer, five nodes in the output layer, and six nodes in the hidden layer.",
