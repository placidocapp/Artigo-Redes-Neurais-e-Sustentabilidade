abstract="Determining the optimal rates of groundwater extraction for the sustainable use of coastal aquifers is a complex water resources management problem. It necessitates the application of a 3D simulation model for coupled flow and transport simulation together with an optimization algorithm in a linked simulation-optimization framework. The use of numerical models for aquifer simulation within optimization models is constrained by the huge computational burden involved. Approximation surrogates are widely used to replace the numerical simulation model, the widely used surrogate model being Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). This study evaluates genetic programming (GP) as a potential surrogate modeling tool and compares the advantages and disadvantages with the neural network based surrogate modeling approach. Two linked simulation optimization models based on ANN and GP surrogate models are developed to determine the optimal groundwater extraction rates for an illustrative coastal aquifer. The surrogate models are linked to a genetic algorithm for optimization. The optimal solutions obtained using the two approaches are compared and the advantages of GP over the ANN surrogates evaluated.",
