    abstract = { AbstractThe maximum dry density (γd,max) and optimum moisture content (ωopt) determined from the results of the Proctorr test are very important for geotechnical engineering and earth structures. As the Proctor test is relatively time consuming and laborious, in present research Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH) type neural network (NN) is used to estimate the compaction parameters (γd,max and ωopt) of soils indirectly from more simply determined index properties such as liquid limit (LL), plastic limit (PL) and fine-grained content (FC) as well as sand content (SC). A database containing 212 data-sets were used for the training and testing of the models. A comparison was carried out between the experimentally measured compaction parameters with the predictions in order to evaluate the performance of the GMDH method. The results demonstrate that generalised GMDH-type NN has a great ability for prediction of the γd,max and ωopt. At the end, sensitivity analysis of the obtained model has been carried out to study the influence of input parameters on model outputs, and shows that the LL and PL are the most influential parameters on the compaction parameters. }
