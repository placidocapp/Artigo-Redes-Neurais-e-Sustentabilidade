    abstract = { Prediction of missing rainfall of rain gauge stations is essentially required for efficient rainfall-runoff modelling in a catchment. Existing conventional methods are being used for prediction of missing rainfall at a station using the data of the same duration from surrounding stations. Owing to its pattern recognition ability and understanding of nonlinear phenomena, an artificial neural network (ANN) has been used in the present study to develop a model for prediction of missing rainfall at a rain gauge station using past observed data of surrounding stations and the station for which part of time series were missing. The performance of the proposed ANN model (BPNN and LM algorithm) has been verified with existing conventional methods for two rain gauge stations for which part of rainfall time series were missing, in the Purna catchment of Tapi basin. The ANN model performed relatively better in rainfall prediction of both the stations for all time scales studiedâ€”daily, 10-day and monthly durations. }
