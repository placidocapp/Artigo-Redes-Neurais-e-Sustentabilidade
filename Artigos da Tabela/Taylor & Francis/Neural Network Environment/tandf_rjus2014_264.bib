    abstract = { The issue of air quality is now a major concern around the world and the vehicle emissions model is very important. Most of the current vehicle emission models are multiple regression techniques. In this study, a neural network-based model has been proposed to achieve better estimation accuracy. The estimation performance of two models, the proposed neural network-based model and a general regression model, has been compared using mean absolute error (MAE). A comparative study between two models to estimate vehicle emissions, the proposed neural network-based model and a general regression model, has been conducted to assess the estimation performance of the proposed model in terms of mean absolute percentage error. Experimental results in this study revealed that the neural network model performed better as it was able to decrease the error for emission estimation comparing with the multiple regression models. More importantly, in this study a lookup table (LUT) method has been proposed to overcome the black-box problem, which is a disadvantage of the neural network models. It could be useful for any other researches to estimate emissions without developing and training the neural network model which can be a time-consuming task. }
