    abstract = { Serbia is attempting to synchronize its development with the basic assumptions of sustainable development and, consequently, data about environmental impact are necessary. The main goal of this study was to investigate and evaluate the possibility of using the artificial neural network technique for predicting the environmental indicators of sustainable development, in order to overcome the problem of incomplete data and to simulate various development scenarios and their environmental impact. Based on the results obtained, it may be concluded that an artificial neural network can be applied to model the greenhouse gas emissions as one of the environmental parameters of sustainable development. }
