    abstract = { This paper focuses on modelling of emission inventory, pollutant dispersion by the industrial source complex short term model (ISCST), and neural network analysis of air pollution in Kuwait. A novel neural network‐based scheme is suggested and applied to site‐specific short‐ and medium‐term forecasting of ozone concentrations. Two feed forward artificial neural networks (ANN) are used to improve the performance of time series predictions. Results show that this forecasting technique represents a significant improvement over the conventional ANN approach. }
