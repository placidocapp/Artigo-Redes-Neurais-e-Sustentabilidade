    abstract = { ABSTRACTA model fusion approach was developed based on five artificial neural networks (ANNs) and MODIS products. Static and dynamic ANNs – the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with one and two hidden layers, general regression neural network (GRNN), radial basis function (RBF) and nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs (NARX) – were used to predict the monthly reservoir inflow in Mollasadra Dam, Fars Province, Iran. Leaf area index and snow cover from MODIS, and rainfall and runoff data were used to identify eight different combinations to train the models. Statistical error indices and the Borda count method were used to verify and rank the identified combinations. The best results for individual ANNs were combined with MODIS products in a fusion model. The results show that using MODIS products increased the accuracy of predictions, with the MLP with two hidden layers giving the best performance. Also, the fusion model was found to be superior to the best individual ANNs. }
