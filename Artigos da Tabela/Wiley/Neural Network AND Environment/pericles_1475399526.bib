abstract = {Abstract With the development of rapid industrialization, urbanization, and modernization, water resources have been facing a series of increasingly severe problems in China, especially in urban areas. However, the absence of an effective, scientific evaluation method may lead to a lack of awareness of sustainable water usage. Thus, this paper focuses on performance analysis for regional sustainable water use in China. First, the sustainable water management (SWM) efficiency is defined, and then, six indicators are selected to construct an evaluation index system. Given that experts are usually not completely rational in practice, we need to take the effect of the experts’ nonrationality into consideration when evaluating the SWM efficiency. In view of the indicators’ uncertainty and fuzziness, and the experts’ nonrationality, the hesitant fuzzy TODIM (HF-TODIM; TODIM is an acronym in Portuguese for interactive multicriteria decision making) method, which can capture the influence of the experts’ psychological factors on the evaluation results, is used to evaluate the SWM efficiency. Furthermore, the assessment method is applied to some sample regions in Tuojiang River Basin. Based on the calculated results, some findings and implications for the SWM efficiency in the sample regions are analyzed. Finally, the applied results using the proposed method are compared with the results derived using the HF-TOPSIS (hesitant fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution in hesitant fuzzy environment) method. Through the comparative analysis, we conclude that the HF-TOPSIS method does not take the experts’ psychological factors into consideration, but the HF-TODIM method can avoid this issue and is very useful for the evaluation of the regional SWM efficiency.},,
