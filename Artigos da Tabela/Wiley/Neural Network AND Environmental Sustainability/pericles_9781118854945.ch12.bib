abstract = {Summary There is a need to incorporate soil use and protection concerns into land use planning given the widespread devolution of power to local authorities regarding land-use decision making. Decision Support Systems (DSS) are useful tools for such planning. Consequently, it is essential that land decision support systems are no longer confined to research centers but also adopted by the production sector and public administration. The MicroLEIS DSS developed by the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) is a user-friendly and suitable user-useful tool for local government officials, consultants and other land use decision makers. The evaluation process entails dynamic interactions between soil, climate and management variables. It includes 12 modules that allow for the assessment of soil capability and vulnerability, and the consequences of future global change scenarios. Here, we illustrate the application of MicroLEIS for land use planning in Asia where this kind of assessment is rather scarce. The decision support system was applied for Ahar, located in East Azarbaijan (Iran). Six agro-ecological land evaluation models, constituents of MicroLEIS DSS software, were selected for land evaluation at the regional level. We identified areas suitable for agricultural production, species suitable for restoring areas marginal for crop production, and suitable crop combinations, and performed a soil capability classification in the soil units. Results obtained from each evaluation model are presented and discussed in this chapter. In summary, MicroLEIS technology proved useful in this semi-arid region of Asia for sustainable agro-ecological planning. The kind of assessment described can be extrapolated to other parts of Asia.}
