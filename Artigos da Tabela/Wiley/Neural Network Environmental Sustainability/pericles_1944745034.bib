abstract = {Time series and artificial neural networks (ANNs) are two distinct methodologies that present environmental researchers and managers with the resources to develop reliable and accurate indoor air quality (IAQ) models. The development of valid IAQ models is a fundamental component in the development of risk assessment and mitigation plans that ensure an occupant's exposure to indoor air contaminants are within the permissible IAQ guidelines. This software review paper provides a detailed step-by-step description of the methodology on how one may integrate the use of the multivariate time series and the back propagation neural network (widely used ANN) methods simultaneously in the development of valid in-bus carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide models using available software. © 2015 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 34: 1259–1266, 2015},,
