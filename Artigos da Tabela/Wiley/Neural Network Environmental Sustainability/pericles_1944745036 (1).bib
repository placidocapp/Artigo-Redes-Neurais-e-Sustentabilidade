abstract = {Energy is one of the main factors that must be considered in the discussions of sustainable development. Renewable, clean and cost effective energy sources are preferred but unfortunately no one of the alternative energy sources can meet these demands solely. So, the problem of determining the appropriate energy policy is a multiple criteria decision making problem. In this study, firstly sustainability indicators for energy planning are determined. Then dependencies and feedbacks between indicators and the values of the indicators were investigated and it was seen that Analytic Network Process with benefits, opportunities, costs and risks merits is a suitable method for this complex problem. Both the objective values and group decision of experts were used in the model to cover the quantitative and qualitative judgments. The results indicated that the energy system of Turkey is not sustainable and the sustainable energy scenario of Turkey must increase the share of renewables. This article is an important framework for the sustainable development pathway of Turkey. © 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 36: 627–637, 2017},,
