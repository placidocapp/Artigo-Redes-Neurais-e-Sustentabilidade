abstract = {Abstract Groundwater modelling has emerged as a powerful tool to develop a sustainable management plan for efficient groundwater utilization and protection of this vital resource. This study deals with the development of five hybrid artificial neural network (ANN) models and their critical assessment for simulating spatio-temporal fluctuations of groundwater in an alluvial aquifer system. Unlike past studies, in this study, all the relevant input variables having significant influence on groundwater have been considered, and the hybrid ANN technique [ANN-cum-Genetic Algorithm (GA)] has been used to simulate groundwater levels at 17 sites over the study area. The parameters of the ANN models were optimized using a GA optimization technique. The predictive ability of the five hybrid ANN models developed for each of the 17 sites was evaluated using six goodness-of-fit criteria and graphical indicators, together with adequate uncertainty analyses. The analysis of the results of this study revealed that the multilayer perceptron Levenberg–Marquardt model is the most efficient in predicting monthly groundwater levels at almost all of the 17 sites, while the radial basis function model is the least efficient. The GA technique was found to be superior to the commonly used trial-and-error method for determining optimal ANN architecture and internal parameters. Of the goodness-of-fit statistics used in this study, only root-mean-squared error, r2 and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency were found to be more powerful and useful in assessing the performance of the ANN models. It can be concluded that the hybrid ANN modelling approach can be effectively used for predicting spatio-temporal fluctuations of groundwater at basin or subbasin scales.
